                <span>Romans 10:9-10</span><br>
                That if thou shalt <span class="highlight">confess</span> with thy mouth the <span class="highlight">Lord Jesus</span>,
                and shalt <span class="highlight">believe</span> in thine heart
                that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be <span class="highlight">saved</span>.
                For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth <span class="highlight">confession</span>
                is made unto <span class="highlight">salvation</span>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <p>
                <span>Philippians 2:10-11</span><br>
                That at the name of <span class="highlight">Jesus</span> every knee should <span class="highlight">bow</span>,
                of things in <span class="highlight1">heaven</span>, and things in <span class="highlight1">earth</span>
                , and things under the <span class="highlight1">earth</span>; And that
                <span class="highlight">every</span> tongue should <span class="highlight">confess</span> that
                <span class="highlight">Jesus Christ is Lord</span>, to the glory of God the Father.

            <p>
                <span>Isaiah 45:22-24</span><br>
                Look unto me, and be ye saved, <span class="highlight">all</span> the ends of the earth:
                for I am God, and there is none else.
                I have <span class="highlight">sworn</span> by myself, <span class="highlight">the word</span>
                is gone out of my mouth in
                righteousness, and shall not return,
                That unto me <span class="highlight">every</span> knee shall bow, <span class="highlight">every</span>
                tongue shall <span class="highlight">swear</span>.
                Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come;
                and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.

            <p>
                <span>1 Corinthians 15:22</span><br>
                For as in <span class="highlight">Adam all die</span>, even so in Christ shall
                <span class="highlight">all be made alive</span>.

                <span>Colossians 1:19-20</span><br>
                For it pleased the Father that in him should <span class="highlight">all fulness</span> dwell;
                And, having made <span class="highlight">peace</span> through the blood of his cross, by him to
                <span class="highlight">reconcile all</span> things unto himself;
                by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

                <span>1 Timothy 2:3-4</span><br>
                For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
                Who will have <span class="highlight">all men to be saved</span>, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

                <span>1 Timothy 4:9-10</span><br>
                This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
                For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God,
                who is the <span class="highlight">Saviour of all men</span>, specially of those that believe.

                Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a <span class="highlight2">live coal</span> in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
                And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine
