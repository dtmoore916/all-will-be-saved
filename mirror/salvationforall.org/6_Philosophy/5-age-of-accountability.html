<h1>
    The Age of Accountability
</h1>
<p>
    On June 20, 2001, Andrea Yates drowned her five children, one by one, in
    the bathtub. It is a horrific story. She was suffering from postpartum
    psychosis, but the reasons she gives that drove her to commit such acts are
    telling:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"It was the seventh deadly sin. My children weren't righteous. They
    stumbled because I was evil. The way I was raising them they could never be
    saved," she told the jail psychiatrist. "They were doomed to perish in the
    fires of hell" (Roche 2002).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    She confirmed this line of reasoning motivated her actions again in an
    interview with forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Before you did it," Dietz asked Andrea during one videotaped session, "did
    you think it was wrong?"
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		"No."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Dietz asked, "Why did you not think it wrong?"
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Andrea answered without hesitation. "If I didn't do it, they would be
    tormented by Satan” (Roche 2002).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Her chilling rationale for killing her children was inspired by a misguided
    understanding of hell and the nature of God’s character. She also seemed to
    have the idea that killing her children while they were young would spare
    them from hell and being tormented by Satan there. Where did such an idea
    originate?
</p>
<p>
    The answer to this question lies in an idea that was developed to soften
    the harshness of the traditional doctrine of hell: the age of
    accountability. According to this idea, people must be mature enough to be
    able to cognitively understand their sin and need for a Savior before being
    held accountable for their sins. It seems to be generally assumed that
    people reach this age at around twelve or thirteen years of age (because as
    everyone knows, this age bracket is very mature and able to make sound
    decisions). Actually, it seems one could only arrive at such a conclusion
    if they haven’t spent much time around twelve or thirteen year old kids!
    For most people it is probably one of the most tumultuous and unreasonable
    seasons of their lives!
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, many cling to the age of accountability concept because it
    makes eternal conscious torment in hell seem a little less unjust. After
    all, it’s only adolescents and up who will fry for all eternity, not little
    kids or babies. While this might make one feel <em>slightly</em> better
    about the doctrine, there are still numerous moral and philosophical
    problems with it. We will address these soon, but before we do, let’s first
    consider whether the age of accountability is a biblical concept at all.
    Does the Bible somewhere state that babies and children are not accountable
    for sin until they reach a certain age?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is no. The Bible makes no such claim. Proponents often claim
    that such a concept is implied by certain verses. Here is one that is often
    cited:
</p>
<h3>
    2 Samuel 12:22-23
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said,
    ‘Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may
    live?’ But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I
    shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In context, David’s son, whom he fathered with Bathsheba, has died. It is
    clear that David is saying that he cannot bring his son back to life: he’s
    dead. Then he says, “I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.” For
    some reason, people think that this is support for the age of
    accountability, but it neither explicitly nor implicitly supports such a
    conjecture. David is simply saying that he too will one day join his son in
    death, but his son won’t return to life with him presently. In the Old
    Testament, there is little demonstrable understanding of an afterlife.
    Instead, we see that all go to <em>Sheol</em>, or the grave. David is
    making a clear statement that he too will go to <em>Sheol</em>, but his son
    would not rejoin him in this life. How one can derive the idea that this
    somehow supports the concept that people are not accountable for sin until
    they reach the age of twelve or thirteen is beyond me. This is simply not
    what the verse is about.
</p>
<p>
    There are a few other verses that are sometimes cited but likewise none of
    them really support the age of accountability.&nbsp; For example, people 
	sometimes cite that twelve-year-old Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem to have 
	discussions with religious teachers in the temple in Luke 2.&nbsp; How on 
	earth can this possibly be extrapolated to the concept that twelve is the 
	age of accountability?&nbsp; Once again, this interpretation has nothing to 
	do with what the passage is actually saying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this therefore mean
    that there is no hope for infants and children who have died without
    professing Christ?
</p>
<p>
    Of course not! But we do not need to derive this hope from extra-biblical
    proposal. Instead we can look to the Bible itself and see God’s heart for
    all people. We can see that He is the Savior of all people, the Savior of
    the world, the ransom for all people, and the Good Shepherd who leaves no
    one behind. We can remember Jesus great love for children and that He said,
    "let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the
    kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these" (Matthew 19:14). We can also
    see that His judgments are righteous and fair. We see that God “will repay
    each person according to what they have done,” and judge impartially
    (Romans 2:6), according to “what their deeds deserve” (Jeremiah 17:10, see
    also Revelation 20 and elsewhere). We also see that “the Lord longs to be
    gracious” and will show compassion <em>because</em> He “is a God of
    justice” (Isaiah 30:18).
</p>
<p>
    From these <em>biblical</em> concepts we can be confident that God will
    show mercy to those who were unable to choose him yet. After all, what deed
    has an infant done to merit eternal torment? Too much crying? Too many
    soiled diapers? A righteous judge simply could not condemn infants to
    eternal suffering. That is not a righteous judgment and everyone, in their
    consciences, knows this. And we have actual, biblical support that God will
    judge righteously, instead of unsupported conjecture and an invented
    concept like the age of accountability.
</p>
<h3>
    Problems with The Age of Accountability
</h3>
<p>
    There really is no compelling scriptural reason for holding to the age of 
	accountability.&nbsp; We can, however, trust what the Bible does say about
    God’s character and justice and put our confidence for the salvation of
    children and babies in this.&nbsp; With this understanding, let’s now look at
    some of the philosophical and moral problems created by holding to the age
    of accountability concept.
</p>
<h4>
    Problem 1: Why Let Children Live?
</h4>
<p>
    This is perhaps the most disturbing moral problem that is introduced by the
    age of accountability concept. If it is true that God will be merciful to
    children up until a certain age, after which they will be accountable for
    their sins and tormented forever, why is it morally right to let children
    live? If you can save them by killing them before they reach the age of
    accountability, wouldn’t this be the best possible thing that you could do
    for them? You see, this was the reasoning of Andrea Yates. And the really
    disturbing part about it is that it is actually rational (if it is actually 
	true
    that death at a young age means you will be shown mercy and avoid eternal
    suffering). Of course, everyone knows that murdering children is
    morally wrong and terrible. But the age of accountability concept has the
    potential to make murder and infanticide seem like a moral good, as a
    trade-off between momentary survival on this broken world and eternal bliss
    in heaven.
</p>
<p>
    If the age of accountability were actually true, abortion would also be a
    moral good. Why should a child be raised by unprepared parents in an
    environment that might lead to eternal perdition rather than be aborted and
    go straight to heaven? I certainly do not agree with this notion, but
    holding to the idea that everyone is saved from hell until they reach a
    certain age creates these moral and philosophical questions.&nbsp; Ironically,
    some people like to claim that telling people of God’s great love for all
    of humanity is dangerous. Perhaps instead, creating unbiblical concepts to
    defend the doctrine of eternal conscious torment is the real danger. I
    think the children of Andrea Yates would agree with the latter.
</p>
<h4>
    Problem 2: What Age is <em>the Age</em>?
</h4>
<p>
    Another problem with the age of accountability concept is that it is
    completely arbitrary about the age at which a person is mature enough to be
    accountable. Why on earth would a twelve-year-old with raging hormones in
    one of the most awkward seasons of human existence be prepared to make
    decisions of eternal weight? Why is an eleven-year-old not equally capable
    of understanding the gospel?
</p>
<p>
    If we actually want to think about human development scientifically, it
    must be understood that the brains of twelve-year-olds aren’t even close to
    mature. Instead, “our brains undergo a massive reorganization between our
    12th and 25th years” (Dobbs 2011). The ability to make reasoned mature
    decisions develops rather slowly, according to neuroscientists.&nbsp; 
	Consider the following from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
	Psychiatry:</p>
	<blockquote>
		Scientists have identified a specific region of the brain called the
    amygdala that is responsible for immediate reactions including fear and
    aggressive behavior. This region develops early. However, the frontal
    cortex,
    <strong>
        the area of the brain that controls reasoning and helps us think before
        we act, develops later. This part of the brain is still changing and
        maturing well into adulthood (2016).
    </strong>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    So, the part of the brain that is most significant in making informed,
    mature decisions is still a work in progress well into adulthood. At what
    point does such a brain cross over into the age of accountability? Where is
    the threshold? I think that adults will readily admit continued growth and
    maturation of thought never really stops. We are constantly changing and
    growing. Why should teenagers, whose strangely immature behavior is
    well-documented, be worthy of eternal torment when many of their actions
    seem to be due to an underdeveloped frontal cortex? Inventing an age of
    accountability at which sufficient maturity is attained is artificial and
    arbitrary. It makes far more sense to place our trust in God’s
    righteousness, mercy, justice, and love as the reasons why He won’t
    endlessly torture young people, than to adhere to biblically untenable
    imaginings.
</p>
<h4>
    Problem 3: The End of God’s Love
</h4>
<p>
    Another important question is why God’s love for people ends once they have
    reached a certain age. It is presumed by the age of accountability that God
    loves all children, but then ceases to extend unmerited grace to people
    once they should know better about their sin. Why would this be true when
    the Bible clearly tells us that God’s “love never ends” (1 Corinthians
    13:8)?
</p>
<p>
    There is not a compelling biblical reason to believe that God ceases to
    love individuals because they know they are sinning. Instead we are told
    that “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
    sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). In the story of the prodigal
    son, we see the Father seeing His <em>adult</em> son, who willfully and
    knowingly rebelled, while he “was still a long way off.” His response was
    to run to him, filled with compassion, and throw a great celebration in his
    honor. We are told that this son squandered his inheritance on prostitutes.
    This is no eleven-year-old boy, but rather a consciously defiant adult who
    had snubbed his Father and chosen sin. Yet, God still looks for Him on the
    horizon, waiting for His return and rejoicing when it happens. God’s love
    doesn’t end because we are old enough to know better. Instead, He comes to
    seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10), regardless of their ages.
</p>
<h4>
    Problem 4: The Alternative
</h4>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
    One final observation for traditionalists regarding the age of
    accountability is that one must accept the stark alternative if it is not
    true. If there is no such thing as the age of accountability (and
    biblically there is no compelling evidence for it), then a proponent of the
    traditional doctrine must assert that all infants, unborn children, and
    children below a certain age will experience eternal conscious torment if
    they die before confessing Jesus Christ as Lord. In other words, every
    infant and every miscarried child will be tormented forever, since infants
    and unborn children presumably have no way of professing faith in Christ.
</p>
<p>
    It must be remembered that part of the traditional conceptualization of
    hell is the concept of original sin and that all are born sinful. As the
    Psalmist says: “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my
    mother conceived me” (Psalm 51:5). Therefore, according to the traditional
    doctrine, there is no time at which a person is righteous apart from a
    profession of faith in Christ, and all deserve hell until that happens,
    regardless of age. Indeed, this is why the Catholic church (and other
    Christian groups) have traditionally baptized infants, believing that this
    ceremony protected them from damnation. Thomas Aquinas, for example, states
    “it became necessary to baptize children, that, as in birth they incurred
    damnation<em>…”</em> (Aquinas). But what of those infants who die before
    baptism, those who are stillborn, or those who are miscarried in the womb?
    The traditional doctrine offers no assurance that these children will be
    saved from eternal hell.
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
    Now, some may object that God would not torture infants because that would
    be morally wrong. And they would be right, but they would not be consistent
    with the traditional doctrine. Our consciences, however, do not allow us to
    accept the notion that tormenting babies eternally is morally good; it is
    objectively morally wrong. I have an infant son, and if someone were to
    torture him for no reason, I am 100 percent positive that their actions
    would be evil. I think that everyone knows this deep down.
</p>
<p>
    This is why the age of accountability was created. It is a convenient way
    to escape facing the true implications of the doctrine of eternal torment
    for all unbelievers. As such, it is a crucial underpinning to the doctrine,
    without which many Christians would be unable to stomach its undeniable
    cruelty. Yet, it must be admitted that it is an invention of man that is
    not biblically supported. It is somewhat ironic that traditionalists
    attempt to claim strict adherence to the Bible as the source of truth while
    simultaneously inventing extrabiblical supports to make the hell doctrine
    seem less horrific. It would be more honest to acknowledge that the Bible
    is silent about an age of accountability, and therefore offers us no
    assurance of the salvation of babies if the traditional doctrine is held.
</p>
<p>
    If, however, we hold to the biblical truths of God’s righteous, fair
    justice, His unending mercy, and His deep love for the whole world that He
    came to save, we can have confidence that God will indeed be true to His
    promises to save even the youngest of us who can’t articulate our faith in
    Him yet.
