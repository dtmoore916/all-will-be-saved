<h2>
    The Moral Problem
</h2>
<blockquote>“If you are excited to read this book, you have issues” (Francis Chan,    <em>Erasing Hell Introduction</em>)
</blockquote>
<p>
The above sentence is the very first line of the Introduction for    <em>Erasing Hell</em>, a book that sought to defend the traditional
    doctrine of hell. It is quite a telling statement. Why do I say this?
</p>
<p>
    Well, the saying “you have issues” is pretty much synonymous with the
    following sayings:
</p>
<p>
    “You’re sick in the head!” or
</p>
<p>
    “There’s something wrong with you!” or
</p>
<p>
    “You’re insane!”
</p>
<p>
    In other words, Chan is saying that there is something morally wrong with
    you if you are excited to read his book about hell. The reason why this is
    curious is that he is defending the doctrine of hell, saying that it is
    biblical, and that God will indeed punish people eternally. He is saying
    that hell is part of God’s design. At the same time, he is saying that you
    should not be excited about this aspect of God’s plan, indeed that you have
    a serious moral defect if you are.
</p>
<p>
    He is saying that hell is morally wrong, but that God will do it!
</p>
<p>
    It is possible that some would try to argue otherwise, but if you did not
    feel that the concept of hell was morally abhorrent, why would someone
    “have issues” for being excited about it? It is God’s plan after all, and
    His ways are perfect (Psalm 18:30), are they not?
</p>
<p>
    What is going on here?
</p>
<p>
    It seems that Chan, as well as other hell advocates believe that hell is a
    sort of necessary evil. They don’t see that the biblical basis for the
    doctrine is extremely weak (although it is), so they think that it must be
    defended even though it feels morally wrong.
</p>
<p>
    This is problematic on multiple levels. But first, let’s consider why most
    people have a moral aversion to hell.
</p>
<p>
    I believe the reason for this aversion is obvious. The notion of eternal
    torment for unbelievers sounds like the polar opposite of justice. If any
    legal system proposed a punishment of lifelong torture for any and all
    crimes, we would all say that this system is unfair and unjust. We would fight
    against it on moral grounds as an inhumane, cruel system.
</p>
<p>
    Now remember, the traditional doctrine of hell assigns all unbelievers to a
    fate of <em>eternal</em> torment, even your very nice neighbor who happens
    to be Buddhist, or Hindu, or agnostic or whatever, even though they might
    be much nicer than you are. It also says that anyone who doesn’t hear the
    gospel and respond to it with repentance in this life will be tormented
    endlessly. Even if there was no possible way for them to hear. In some
    traditions, even un-baptized infants would be said to go to some version of
    hell.
</p>
<p>
    Now the problem is that the purposeless, vindictive torturing of people is
    viewed as morally wrong by pretty much everybody in the world. Those who
    derive pleasure from the pain of others are known as sadists, psychopaths,
    and sociopaths. But the doctrine of hell says that God himself will torment
    people endlessly, with no redemptive purpose whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
    To drive this point home, consider the Holocaust. I hope we can all agree
    that the torturing of the Jewish people in concentration camps was evil.
    Now consider that the doctrine of hell says that all of those unbelieving
    Jews will go from being tormented by the Nazis to being tormented forever
    by God. God will double down on Hitler’s agenda, since Hitler could only
    torment people temporarily, but God can now do this eternally.
</p>
<p>
    Doesn’t that scenario make you recoil in disgust? That is because you have
    a conscience. The Bible encourages us to listen to it.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 1:18-19
</h3>
<blockquote>
    This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the
    prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good
    warfare, <strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>
    <strong>
        holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made
        shipwreck of their faith
    </strong>
    …
</blockquote>
<p>
    One of the great philosophical reasons for believing in God is the moral
    law. We have a sense, as humans, that certain things are morally right and
    other things are morally wrong. It is argued by many that this sense of
    objective morality suggests the existence of God. Otherwise, where does the
    idea of right and wrong come from and why are we deeply convinced that
    there is a moral right and wrong?
</p>
<p>
    Some like to argue that morality is purely relative, but this ignores the
    fact that certain things are viewed as morally right or wrong by virtually
    every culture. It also ignores the fact that we are convinced that morality
    is actually real, and not just a cultural construct.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if I ask you if it is morally OK to torture and abuse children
    for fun, what would you say? Would you say that it depends on your cultural
    context? Or would you feel that it is <em>actually</em> morally wrong
    objectively? I think almost everyone agrees that this is actually wrong,
    independent of cultural context.
</p>
<p>
    In the same way, we feel that the idea of eternal torment of people in hell
    is actually morally wrong, hence Francis Chan’s statement that “you have
    issues” if you are excited to read about it.
</p>
<p>
    Now some people will say that hell feels wrong but that God has the right
    and the power to do as he pleases. While true, this in no way solves the
    moral problem. Instead it says that God is allowed to do something immoral
    simply because He has the power to do so. A brutal dictator has the power
    to kill and torture at will as well, but this doesn’t make these actions
    morally acceptable.
</p>
<p>
    Also, it ignores the clear statements in Scripture that tell us what God’s
    will actually is. For example, the Bible clearly says that our God and
    Savior “
    <strong>
        wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
    </strong>
    For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man
    Christ Jesus, who gave himself <strong>as a ransom for all people</strong>”
    (1 Timothy 2:4-6).
</p>
<p>
    God doesn’t want to torment people, but rather wants salvation for all. Now
    if He really has the right and power to do as he pleases, won’t he actually
    do as he pleases?
</p>
<p>
    Consider Ezekiel 33:11:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the
    death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live.
    Turn! Turn from your evil ways!
	</blockquote>
<p>
    He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked because He wants repentance
    and life. The doctrine of hell, far from supporting God’s sovereignty, says
    that God is unable to do what He actually wants to do. It says that he
    “wants all people to be saved” but that people prevent Him from
    accomplishing His purpose.
</p>
<p>
    In our consideration of the validity of the doctrine of hell, isn’t it at
    least pertinent to consider what God says about Himself? Isn’t it also
    worthwhile to ask why the doctrine violates our God-given consciences? If
    eternal torment for the vast majority of people on earth grates on your
    moral sense, shouldn’t you at least consider the possibility that it does
    so for a reason?
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps it is the Holy Spirit in you, whispering truth to your conscience.
    Don’t ignore Him.
