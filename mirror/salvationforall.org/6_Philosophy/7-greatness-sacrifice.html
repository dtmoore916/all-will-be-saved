	<h1>The Greatness of the Sacrifice
</h1>
	<blockquote>
		“The doctrine of hell is important because it is the only way to know how
    much Jesus loved us and how much he did for us… Unless we come to grips
    with this "terrible" doctrine, we will never even begin to understand the
    depths of what Jesus did for us on the cross” (Keller, 2009).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The above quote by Timothy Keller makes the thesis that we cannot
    understand the greatness of Jesus’ love and sacrifice without the doctrine
    of eternal conscious torment in hell. Essentially, his logic is that the
    extreme everlasting nature of the penalty for sin allows us to understand
    the depths of Jesus’ love. Generally, I have enjoyed several things that
    I’ve read from Timothy Keller, but <em>this</em> is a rather bizarre
    argument for several reasons.
</p>
<h4>
    The Greatness of Christ
</h4>
<p>
    First, let me submit to you that if you can only comprehend the greatness
    of Christ’s sacrifice if the punishment for sin is eternal and horrific,
    that you do not fully appreciate the greatness of Christ Himself. The One
    through whom all things were created died a bloody, cruel death on a cross
    as the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world!
</p>
<p>
    Why is it that this fact doesn’t awe you unless <em>other</em> people are
    eternally consciously tormented?
</p>
<p>
    It is not the greatness of the punishment that should lead us to realize
    the awesome nature of Christ’s work, but rather the greatness of Christ
    Himself and His love for us. The Lord of all “who, being in very nature God
    did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own
    advantage” but rather “made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a
    servant” and “humbled himself by becoming obedient to death… on a cross”
    (Philippians 2:6-8). Why does the eternal suffering of the lost make this
    more significant?
</p>
<p>
The simple answer is that it does not. Instead, it makes Jesus’ work much    <em>less</em> significant. I say this because it is obviously true. If we
    say that Christ’s sacrifice only truly paid for a select few (as Keller’s
    Calvinist tradition asserts), then His sacrifice is far less significant
    than if it paid for all people as the Bible clearly and repeatedly states
    (1 John 2:2, 1 Timothy 2:6, 1 Timothy 4:10, John 6:33 etc.). If His work on
    the cross also atoned for His enemies and for those who denied Him, it
    demonstrates a far more meaningful, unconditional love, than if He only
    died for those who were already His friends. As Jesus Himself said:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners
    love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you,
    what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those
    from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners
    lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do
    good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then
    your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High,
    because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your
    Father is merciful” (Luke 6:32-36).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this passage, Jesus tells us about the true love of God that extends to
    all people, even to His enemies, to the ungrateful and to the wicked. And
    we to are exhorted to be <em>like Him</em> by loving our enemies as well.
    We are to be merciful, <em>as He is merciful</em>. What can this mean if it
    does not mean that God is merciful to, and loves His enemies? The greatness
    of Christ’s sacrifice is evident in that His love extends even to those
    mockers who spat upon and beat Him, to the very men who started the riot
    that resulted in His crucifixion, and to those who drove the nails through
    His flesh. <em>This</em> is what is astounding and amazing. <em>This</em>
    is the unbelievable love demonstrated by God who came to earth to die for
    us while we were still sinners.
</p>
<h4>
    The Nature of Love
</h4>
<p>
    A second reason to doubt Keller’s claim that we cannot comprehend how much
    Jesus loved us and how much he did for us without eternal hell is that the
    concept of eternal hell actually obscures the depth of Christ’ love. It is
    undeniable that tormenting someone forever is inconsistent with love. For
    Scriptural proof of this fact, let’s now turn to 1 Corinthians 13:4-8:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Love is <strong>patient</strong>, love is <strong>kind</strong>. It does
    not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others,
it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,    <strong>it keeps no record of wrongs</strong>. Love does not delight in
    evil but rejoices with the truth. It <strong>always protects</strong>,
always trusts, <strong>always hopes</strong>,    <strong>always perseveres</strong>.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>Love never fails</strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is not difficult to see that torturing someone endlessly is not kind, or
    patient. A love that ends simply because of a cessation of metabolism does
    not always hope or always persevere, and so is not true<em> agape</em> love
    (God’s love) that <em>never fails</em>. A doctrine of eternal punishment
    for past sins clearly keeps a permanent, unforgiven record of wrongs and
    demonstrates no desire to protect those who have been unable to come to
    understand the gospel fully in this dark world. In summary, the doctrine of
    eternal conscious torment completely fails to demonstrate God’s love as
    described biblically. Instead, it demonstrates something far more similar
    to the conditional, imperfect “love” of flawed humanity. It makes one
    wonder from where such a doctrine truly originated.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to note that the view that eternal hell is necessary
    to understand God’s love is self-focused. Remember, Keller does not believe
    that he himself will actually experience hell. How then can he fully
    understand it as a penalty? The truth is that he cannot. But for some
    reason, knowing that <em>other</em> people will experience this penalty
    enhances his understanding of God’s love <em>for him</em>. If he were in
    the proverbial flames, it is doubtful that hell would have the same effect
    of convincing him of God’s great love. So, the argument is that simply
    knowing that others will be tormented should enhance the understanding of
    believers of God’s love for us. Doesn’t that seem a little self-centered?
    How is that consistent with loving our neighbors as ourselves as Jesus
    taught?
</p>
<p>
    Remember, the doctrine of hell insists that eternal conscious torment is a
    penalty that will be actualized for most people. It is not simply the
    hypothetical punishment that Christ fully paid for (that no one will
    experience). Instead, it is thought that many billions will experience it,
    indeed the vast majority of humanity. Does that make us feel better about
    ourselves and more secure of God’s love for us? If so, why?
</p>
<h4>
    Philosophical Assumptions
</h4>
<p>
    To be fair, this is not the way Keller frames the argument. Instead, he
    frames it like this:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		When he cried out that his God had forsaken him he was experiencing hell
    itself. But consider--if our debt for sin is so great that it is never paid
    off there, but our hell stretches on for eternity, then what are we to
    conclude from the fact that Jesus said the payment was "finished" (John
    19:30) after only three hours? We learn that what he felt on the cross was
    far worse and deeper than all of our deserved hells put together (Keller,
    2009).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This argument, however, is based on unsupported philosophical assumptions.
    First, it is acknowledged that Jesus’ payment on the cross for sins was
    finished after only three hours, but it is then assumed, without any
    biblical or philosophical reason, that this three-hour experience must
    equate to billions of eternal experiences. Why? Is this the only reasonable
    conclusion we can draw from Jesus’ statement, “it is finished” in John
    19:30? Could we not instead believe that He meant to convey the completion
    of His sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, and that the ransom for
    all people was paid in full?
</p>
<p>
    Is it necessary to invent the idea that Christ suffered multiple eternities
    worth of punishment on the cross? There is no biblical support for such an
    idea; it relies entirely on the faulty assumption that <em>aionios</em>
    must mean eternal (which has already been debunked). Would it not make more
    sense to believe that Christ was able to pay the debt of all people in
    three hours because of <em>His greatness</em>? As Romans 6:23 tells us:
    “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in
    Christ Jesus our Lord.” Christ <em>died</em> and His death paid for the
    death that we earned because He is the eternal God and His power is mighty
    to save. Saying that He experienced billions of eternities in a few hours
    is simply made up. His death alone was sufficient to atone for everyone.
</p>
<p>
    It also must be acknowledged that if Christ truly experienced everyone’s
    hell, that He has in fact atoned for everyone. Why would it be necessary to
    pay a debt that is already paid? If the eternal God, as Christ, paid your
    eternal debt, why would you still owe it? The typical Calvinist answer is
    that Christ did not really pay for everyone but only for the elect, a
    doctrine known as limited atonement. This doctrine is deeply unbiblical and
    can be refuted by a number of verses, but I will just mention the one that
    most specifically contradicts it: “He is the atoning sacrifice for our
    sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world” (1
    John 2:2).
</p>
<p>
    So now we have the choice of either believing the clear 
	Scriptural teaching that Christ atoned for the sins of the whole world, or 
	believing an unbiblical principle that Christ’s atoning sacrifice was very 
	limited in scope.&nbsp; If we believe the former, it must be admitted that 
	individual sinners no longer need to <em>atone </em>for their sins; they are 
	already paid for.&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't to say that <em>purification</em> 
	or<em> sanctification </em>is no longer necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this 
	still must occur for all people, even believers.&nbsp; As 1 Peter 4:17 tells 
	us "judgment must begin at the house of God" (KJV).&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose 
	of such judgment is clearly refining, and makes us more like Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	But the <em>atonement</em> for sin is complete.&nbsp; Since this debt has 
	been paid in full by Christ, it is no longer owed by anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
	therefore makes no sense to force billions of people to pay a debt that was 
	already paid.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    &nbsp;If, on the other hand, we decide that Christ did not pay for the sins 
	of the whole world, we are left with an unbiblical
    principle that Christ’s atoning sacrifice was only for some people.&nbsp; It
    must be pointed out again that such a limited scope of atonement (besides
    being contrary to multiple biblical texts) <em>lessens</em> the impact,
    love, and power of Jesus, suggesting that He was unwilling (or unable) to
    save most of humanity. So, which is it? Is God a cheat who behaves like a
    tax-collector of old, collecting more than His due? Or is He unwilling or
    unable to save?
</p>
	<p>
    I believe, of course, that there is a better option.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can accept 
	the clear scriptural teaching that Jesus is the Savior and atoning sacrifice 
	for all people, acknowledging that <em>we</em> do not see the fullness of 
	that reality <em>yet</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Hebrews 2:8 tells us:<blockquote>
		Now <strong>in putting everything in subjection to him</strong>, he left 
		<strong>nothing outside his control</strong>. At present, we do not 
		<strong>yet</strong> see everything in subjection to him.&nbsp; But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that <strong>by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone</strong>. 
	</blockquote>
	<p>He tasted death for everyone because he is the Savior of all people and 
	the atoning sacrifice for the whole world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because everyone 
	has not already accepted Christ yet, does not mean that it will not occur.&nbsp; 
	The Scriptures assure us that it will and that every knee will bow and every 
	tongue confess His Lordship.&nbsp; We are inherently short-sighted and limit 
	God's power when we assume that His will couldn't possibly be accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	It might <em>seem </em>too difficult to us to bring about willing repentance 
	in all hearts, but there is nothing outside His control and he will succeed 
	in His purpose to unite all things in Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<h4>
    An Attempt to Explain the Lack of Parity
</h4>
<p>
    Now, getting back to Keller’s rationale for why three hours on the cross
    equates to the eternal suffering of billions, this is what he says:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		And this makes emotional sense when we consider the relationship he lost.
    If a mild acquaintance denounces you and rejects you--that hurts. If a good
    friend does the same--that hurts far worse. However, if your spouse walks
    out on you saying, "I never want to see you again," that is far more
    devastating still. The longer, deeper, and more intimate the relationship,
    the more tortuous is any separation. But the Son's relationship with the
    Father was beginningless and infinitely greater than the most intimate and
    passionate human relationship. When Jesus was cut off from God he went into
    the deepest pit and most powerful furnace, beyond all imagining. He
    experienced the full wrath of the Father. And he did it voluntarily, for us
    (Keller, 2009).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The clear problem with this reasoning is that Christ knew full well that
    his separation from the Father was temporary. He had <a name="_GoBack"></a>
    prophesied of His own resurrection on multiple occasions. There was no
    possibility of eternal separation and so He experienced the agony of
    temporary separation. If the payment that Christ paid was temporary, this
    provides further evidence that the payment required of individual human
    beings is also temporary.
</p>
<p>
    You see, the analogy given of a spouse walking out and saying “I never want
    to see you again,” is a false one. God never said such a thing to Jesus,
    nor did Jesus believe that this was the case. He knew that He would rise
    again on the third day, conquering death for everyone. His restoration to
    the Father was assured, just as the restoration of all to God is assured to
    us by His word. Every knee and every tongue, united, subjected, and
    reconciled to Him. These are truths that are testified to again and again
    and must not be ignored.
</p>
<p>
    None of this minimizes the significance of Christ’s suffering or His love.
    He still voluntarily suffered and died a literally excruciating death to
    demonstrate his love for us. As His words tell us: “Greater love has no one
    than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” We don’t need to
    add billions of eternal hell sentences to His words in a vain attempt to
    make His work more significant. It already is the most significant and
    greatest love imaginable. The perfect atoning sacrifice of God Himself
    needs no embellishment.
