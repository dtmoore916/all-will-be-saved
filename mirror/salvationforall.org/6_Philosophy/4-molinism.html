<h1>
    Molinism
</h1>
<p>
    There is another philosophical proposition that seeks to explain the role
    of human free will in light of God’s sovereignty that is also worth
    addressing. It is called Molinism, and is named after the 16th century
    Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, who first promoted it. In modern times,
    it has been advocated by famous philosophers such as Alvin Platinga and
    William Lane Craig, both of whom are respected Christian apologists. And it
    seems to be growing in popularity. In an interview with William Lane Craig
    on Molinism, he says the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Dean Zimmerman, a fine Christian philosopher at Rutgers University and not
    himself a Molinist, has said that Molinism is probably the most popular
    view of the relationship between divine sovereignty and human choices. That
    doesn't mean it is a majority view. It might be, say, 35% but every other
    view is 20% or 15% or less. So it is the most popular view out there, he
    says, among philosophers” (<a
        href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/is-molinism-biblical/#_ftn4"
    >Craig &amp; Harris 2017</a>).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    So, what is Molinism? It can get fairly complicated but I will give a short
    summary of the basic concept. Molinism proposes that God has a type of
    knowledge known as “middle knowledge.” This middle knowledge is the
    knowledge of what free individuals would choose in any given context or
    situation. So far, so good. This seems reasonable and possible to find some
    support for biblically.
</p>
<p>
    But the next part is where the idea gets very speculative and biblically
    tenuous at best. The concept goes that since God knows all possible choices
    of humans in any circumstance, He therefore surveyed all possible worlds,
    and actualized the one in which his free creatures would freely choose to
    accomplish His will and purposes. Therefore, God is still sovereign because
    He determines the outcome, but people still have free will.
</p>
<p>
    There are several philosophical problems with this view. One significant
    problem is that it does not adequately explain the role of free will such
    that our choices are actually our own. If God knows what you will choose in
    any circumstance, and He chooses to place you in a particular circumstance,
    are you really making an authentic choice? Isn’t He choosing which choice
    you will make by placing you in that particular situation? What if you
    would have chosen to become a Christian if you were born in Indianapolis,
    but God decided for you to be born in Calcutta where you never heard the
    gospel? Why did He actualize that world instead of the one in which you
    would have freely chosen Christ?
</p>
<p>
    Because the Molinist assumes eternal hell to be a reality, the position is
    really no different than the Calvinist position that God chooses who He
    will save and who He will condemn to eternal suffering and/or separation
    from Him. The only difference is the method He uses to choose. The
    Calvinist has the idea that He chooses between individuals, but the
    Molinist says He chooses between worlds, thereby resulting in the choice of
    particular individuals.
</p>
<p>
    Not only does Molinism fail to adequately explain free agency, it also
    fails to accept God’s sovereignty. The following excerpt from an interview
    of William Lane Craig by Kevin Harris illustrates this quite well. In it,
    Dr. Craig is responding to criticisms by a Calvinist.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em><strong>KEVIN HARRIS:</strong></em>
    He cites four or five scriptures here that seem to mitigate against
    Molinism and give a little hard predestinarian view.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <em><strong>DR. CRAIG:</strong></em>
    Right. He quotes a number of scriptures that affirm that God accomplishes
    all things according to the counsel of his will. The difficulty in
    interpreting these passages to mean that God unilaterally determines
    everything that happens or could happen is that the Scripture also affirms
    things like
    <em>
        God is not willing that any should perish but that all should reach
        repentance
    </em>
    (2 Peter 3:9). Here Peter affirms that it is God's will that no one be
    lost, or in other words that everyone be saved. And yet we know that that
    will is not accomplished. It is these passages that teach the universal
    salvific will of God for all persons to be saved that persuades me that
    Matt is wrong in quoting these passages to say that everything that happens
    is God's will. (<a
        href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/is-molinism-biblical/#_ftn4"
    >Craig &amp; Harris 2017</a>).
</blockquote>
<p>
    I agree with Dr. Craig that God does not unilaterally determine everything
    that happens. People are not puppets who simply do exactly as they are
    commanded. Asserting that we are is not only counterintuitive, but also
    makes God solely responsible for every evil ever committed. If Hitler was
    simply God’s pawn with no free will of his own, then he wasn’t responsible
    for the holocaust; God was. This is, of course, not a scriptural view of
    God’s character, or of God’s relationship to human beings.
</p>
<p>
    But when the Bible says that God works out all things according to the
    counsel of His will, it is not claiming that God unilaterally determines
    everything that happens. Instead it is clarifying that God works out
    whatever happens so that His will is ultimately fulfilled, regardless of
    human choices. Let’s revisit one of the verses that states that God works
    out all things according the counsel of His will, and we will see this to
    be the case.
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 1:7-12
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our
    trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon
    us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the
    fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things
    on earth.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according
    to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his
    will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the
    praise of his glory.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    We have already looked at this passage, but it is worth revisiting because
    it is so often misunderstood. Notice that God has revealed that His will
    and purpose are to unite all things in Christ. So when He works out all
    things according to His will, there is no sense in which he must
    micromanage every aspect of human behavior. We choose to lie. We choose to
    steal. We choose to hate. God takes all of this brokenness and redeems all
    of us anyway. That is how He works all things according to the counsel of
    His will. No matter what we choose, He ultimately accomplishes his clearly
    stated purpose: unity in Christ for all.
</p>
<p>
    It is fallacious to say that the fulfillment of God’s will means that He
    unilaterally determines everything that happens. His will is clearly stated
    to be ultimate reconciliation and unity in Christ. There is no good
    biblical reason to assume that His will is to micromanage every aspect of
    human behavior. Instead, when 2 Peter 3:9 says that “
    <em>
        God is not willing that any should perish but that all should reach
        repentance,
    </em>
    ” the text means exactly what it says. God’s will that He purposed in
    Christ is for all to reach repentance.
</p>
	<div class="box">
		As a reminder, the word translated “willing” in 2 Peter 3:9 is
		<em>
        boulomenos</em>
    (βουλόμενος). According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1014.htm">HELPS Word-studies</a>,    <em>boulomenos</em> has the connotation of resolute planning and "is a
    strong term that underlines the predetermined (and determined) intention
    driving the planning (wishing, resolving)."
</div>
<p>
    It is a misunderstanding of God’s will as micromanagement that leads Dr.
    Craig to be persuaded that God’s will is not accomplished. Let’s look at
    what he says again:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Here Peter affirms that it is God's will that no one be lost, or in other
    words that everyone be saved. And yet we know that that will is not
    accomplished. It is these passages that teach the universal salvific will
    of God for all persons to be saved that persuades me that Matt is wrong in
    quoting these passages to say that everything that happens is God's will.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Dr. Craig rightly acknowledges that Peter is teaching that God wills 
	to save all people. That is unmistakably exactly what Peter is teaching. But 
	then he says something for which there is no scriptural support: “And yet we 
	know that that will is not accomplished.” What? How do we know that God’s 
	will is not accomplished? The Bible clearly disagrees with this
    notion. Here is a short list of just a few verses that contradict the
    notion that God is unable to accomplish His will.

    It is undeniable that God accomplishes his will and succeeds in what He
    purposes to do. He has very clearly stated His purpose to be unity of all
    in Christ (Ephesians 1), reconciliation of all people to God through Christ
    (Colossians 1 and 2 Corinthians 5), and ultimate repentance for all people
    (2 Peter 3).
</p>
<p>
    People claim that this does not occur because we don’t see it in our
    lifetimes for every person on earth. But God is not restricted to our
    lifetimes. Just because we don’t see every person on earth come to faith in
    Christ doesn’t mean that God is unable to reach them beyond our lifetimes.
    He has the keys to death and Hades (Revelation 1:18). That means that He is
    able to unlock the gates and free those held captive there. Indeed, we are
    specifically told that is what He has done.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Peter 3:18-20 (NIV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous,
    to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the
    Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the
    imprisoned spirits— to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited
    patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built…
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Peter 4:6 (NASB)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are
    dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the
    spirit according to <em>the will of</em> God.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Our limited vantage point as human beings does not restrict God. He is
    sovereign and has the ability to save whenever he chooses, even after death
    and postmortem judgment. There is no good scriptural reason to assume
    otherwise. Therefore, we <em>do not know</em> that God fails to accomplish
    his will. If we take the scriptures as our guide, we should know the
    opposite. But the doctrine of eternal hell has forced some rather bizarre
    reasoning to dominate, even among brilliant philosophers. Let’s examine an
    example of this now from the interview with Dr. Craig.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		<em><strong>KEVIN HARRIS:</strong></em>
    I heard a theologian quote that verse the other day about God's not willing
    that any of us should perish. He said God is an aspiring universalist. God
    would be a universalist but God knows that sadly it's not going to happen.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<em><strong>DR. CRAIG:</strong></em>
    Right. So the Calvinist needs to reinterpret these passages to say it
    really means that God wants all types of persons to be saved but it's not
    really his will that everyone be saved otherwise everyone would be saved. I
    think that it is a much more plausible interpretation of these passages to
    take them at face value (<a
        href="https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/is-molinism-biblical/#_ftn4"
    >Craig &amp; Harris 2017</a>).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    First, notice that Dr. Craig does not contradict the notion that God is an
    “aspiring universalist.” Instead, he agrees. This is, to say the least, a
    bizarre notion of God. How could God aspire to anything? Doesn’t He have
    the power to do what He wants? Didn’t He create the universe and all of us?
    God is the ultimate Being. There is nothing to aspire to beyond Himself. Is
our free will really capable of overriding God’s will, such that “God    <em>would be a universalist</em>, but God knows that sadly it’s not going
    to happen”? This notion gives human beings too much credit. It places our
    will above God’s. He isn’t sovereign in this view; <em>we are</em>. As
    someone I greatly respect pointed out in a discussion, this is akin to
    idolatry of man’s will since we are placing our will above God, indeed, in
    His place. It asserts that we have the power, so God is sadly powerless to
    accomplish his purpose.
</p>
<p>
    But this is nonsense. God is not an aspiring universalist; He<em> is</em> a
    universalist. And it would be wise for us to <em>aspire</em> to be like Him
    and earnestly desire what He desires, the salvation and reconciliation of
    all people to Himself. As Dr. Craig rightly points out in his discussion of
    2 Peter 3:9 and other passages that proclaim God’s universal salvific will,
    “it is a much more plausible interpretation of these passages to take them
    at face value.” Once we understand this and have a right understanding of
    God’s sovereignty, we can come to the rational, biblically consistent view
    that God succeeds in accomplishing his purpose to unite all in Christ in
    his timing. The Bible is clear about God’s will and clear about His ability
    to accomplish it. Taking these passages at face value for what they
    actually say leads to one inescapable conclusion: the ultimate
    reconciliation of all to God as we are united in Christ.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of eternal damnation (which has little to no actual Scriptural
    support in the original languages of the Bible), muddies our understanding
    of God’s character and power. It leads to convoluted philosophical
    propositions that deny either God’s goodness and love, or His sovereignty.&nbsp; Let’s not do this.
</p>
	<p>
    Instead we should embrace the clear meaning of the Scriptures by faith even 
	if we don’t see everyone come to Christ in our lifetimes “for we walk by 
	faith, not by sight” (2 Corinthians 5:7). We must remember that “faith is 
	the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen” 
	(Hebrews 11:1). Therefore, if God desires for
    all people to be saved, we should hope for the same thing. And we should be
    assured that what we hope for will come to pass even if we do not see it
    now, because our hope is in the “living God who is the Savior of all
    people, especially of those who believe” (1 Timothy 4:10).
