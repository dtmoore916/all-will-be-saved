<h2>
    <u>What is Justice?</u>
    <u></u>
</h2>
<p>
    One thing that is often said of God is that he would not be worthy of
    worship if He were not just. While I tend to agree with this thought at one
    level, I think it is very important to arrive at a sane understanding of
    justice if it is to have its proper meaning. Justice is indeed important,
    but what is justice?
</p>
<p>
    The most common version of divine “justice” described in Christian churches
    is that each and every sin merits eternal conscious torment as punishment.
    So, if you have ever lied, cheated, stolen, lusted, or failed in any way,
    the deserved punishment is eternal misery. Some would go further than this
    and say that original sin is inherited and that you deserve said punishment
    simply because you are a human being and Adam’s sin is imputed to you, in
    which case even unbaptized infants would not escape their due eternal
    suffering if they died (Augustine, for example, was a proponent of this
    view). At any rate, the deserved punishment for sin of any kind is viewed
    as never-ending.
</p>
<p>
    This is the standard explanation, it seems, in most churches. Nevertheless,
    no matter how comfortable you have become with parroting the standard
    platitudes about why this is just, I can prove to you that you do not
    actually believe it.
</p>
<p>
    Picture a justice system on earth that operates this way. Imagine that the
    government decides to apply these principles and that your five-year-old
    daughter steals a lollipop, and then lies about it. That’s two sins times
    infinity (which is still just infinity). The government catches your little
    girl and ties her to the torturing table where she will remain in anguish,
    deprived of all good things, and be tormented (whether physically,
    psychologically, or whatever) for the rest of her days. If death seems
    imminent for the child at any point, the justice system has found a way to
    keep her alive indefinitely with the sole purpose of extending her torture.
</p>
<p>
    Is this just? Yes, or no?
</p>
<p>
    Have you ever sinned? Would you be OK with someone tossing you into a
miserable dungeon and torturing <em>you</em> forever since that is what    <em>you</em> “deserve”? Is this really justice?
</p>
<p>
    I know that people will be tempted to try to explain their reasoning with a
    bunch of pious-sounding nonsense but resist the temptation and just answer
    the question. Are these scenarios <em>just</em>? Are they morally right and
    fair? Yes or No?
</p>
<p>
    I imagine, if you are a sane person, that you answered “No” to the above
    questions. Any justice system on earth that assigned never-ending torment
    as the consequence for any lawbreaking would be considered perverse,
    backward, and evil. Why, then, do we ascribe this sort of evil to God
    Himself?
</p>
<p>
    Now, some will argue that it would be different for a government to do this
    since they do not have the same rights as God, but that God can do
    something like this if He wants to. But this does not address the question
    of whether the penalty being given is morally right or just. An
    individual’s power to do something is irrelevant in determining the moral
    nature of the act. Certainly, Hitler had the power to send Jews to
    concentration camps and Stalin had the power to send millions of his own
    people to the gulag labor camps. But their acts were still evil and unjust.
</p>
<p>
    At any rate, I do not dispute that God can do what He wants; I am arguing
    that He not only <em>can</em> do what He wants, but that He <em>will</em>
    do what he wants. It is rather curious that those who wish to defend the
    doctrine of eternal conscious torment by saying that God can do as he
    pleases do not consider the Bible’s words about what he pleases. But we
    will:
</p>
<p>
    1 Peter 3:9 tells us that God is “not willing that any should perish but
    that all should come to repentance.” 1 Timothy 2:4 says that God “desires
    all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.” And Ezekiel
    33:11 shows us God’s heart, saying “'As surely as I live, declares the
    Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather
    that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways!”
    God <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> see his desire for all people to be
    saved and come to knowledge of the truth come to fruition, because He is
    God and has no limitation in His ability to act for the benefit of those He
    loves, not even physical death, for Jesus said, “I hold the keys of death
    and Hades” (Revelation 1:18).
</p>
<p>
    So, it is clear that God <em>does not want</em> to send people to eternal
    torment and that He is not restricted to our timelines. It is also clear
    that eternal torment is morally evil and unjust. God is under no obligation
    to commit untold atrocities (tormenting billions of people forever) to
    fulfill the demands of the man-made justice system promoted by the “forever
hell” camp. The reason I say it is man-made is that there is    <em>not a single verse anywhere</em> in the Bible that says that each sin
    deserves eternal punishment. At most, we find that the wages of sin is
    death (Romans 6:23), but to interpret the word “death” as “eternal
    conscious torment” is an unwarranted stretch of epic proportions,
    especially since the context of Romans 6 prohibits such an interpretation
    (we are brought <em>from</em> death to life etc.). In what sense can
“death” mean <em>eternal</em> conscious torment if we were brought    <em>from it to life</em>?
</p>
<p>
    In fact, we have abundant biblical evidence that God’s anger about sin is
temporary. For example, Psalm 30:5 tells us that God’s “anger lasts    <em>only a moment</em>, but his favor <em>lasts a lifetime</em>.” The
    contrast in duration is clear: a <em>moment</em> vs. a <em>lifetime</em>.
    God’s anger does not continue to burn forever as He watches billions of
    tortured souls in hell. Instead, in Jeremiah 3:12 God declares, “I will not
    be angry forever” and in Ezekiel 16:42 He states, “I will be calm and no
    longer angry.” In contrast to a judgment that lasts forever, we know that
    “mercy triumphs over judgment” (James 2:13). In contrast to a God of hatred
    and anger, we see a God who <em>is</em> love (1 John 4:8). We see
    biblically that “love never ends” (1 Corinthians 13:8) and that God’s
    “mercy endures forever” (too many places to cite, but you can click
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=mercy+endures+forever&amp;qs_version=NKJV"
    >
        here
    </a>
    to see them).
</p>
<p>
    We <em>never</em> see equivalent statements about God’s anger, hatred, or
    judgment, despite the concerted effort by so many to make it seem so. The
    image of an eternally angry God who delights in the endless suffering of
    the damned is simply false and unbiblical. It is derived from surrounding
    pagan cultures that had exactly these types of capricious, angry deities
    that needed to be appeased.
</p>
<h4>
    Another Conception of Justice
</h4>
<p>
    What if the plainly unjust descriptions of “justice” that so many churches
    insist upon are not accurate? It is my firm conviction that true divine
    justice involves appropriate, fair punishment that is corrective and
    restorative in nature. The Bible describes in many places that people will
    be judged according to what they have done (see
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=according+to+their+deeds&amp;qs_version=NKJV"
    >
        here
    </a>
    , Revelation 20:12, etc.). God’s judgments will be fair and proportional to
    the wickedness of each individual, just as they are in any sane justice
    system on earth (many of which are based, incidentally, on biblical
    principles of justice). In such a system, people receive appropriate
    consequences for their sin that ultimately result in repentance and
    restoration. The wicked turn from their evil ways and live. Though the
    discipline is painful, all come to a saving knowledge of the truth, just as
    God desires. This is a fitting justice system for a loving Father who does
    not abandon his children, but rather disciplines them as part of the
    process of “making everything new” (Revelation 21:5). The end result is
    that “there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the
    old order of things has passed away” (Revelation 21:4). The victim and the
    perpetrator are reconciled to each other and to God, such that all will
    rejoice at the judgment of God.
</p>
<p>
    Psalm 98 well describes this version of justice that results in rejoicing
    for all creation:
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 98
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Oh sing to the Lord a new song,
    <br/>
    for he has done marvelous things!
    <br/>
    His right hand and his holy arm

    <br/>
    to the house of Israel.

    Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre,
    <br/>
    with the lyre and the sound of melody!
    <br/>
    With trumpets and the sound of the horn
    <br/>
    make a joyful noise before the King, the Lord!
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
    <br/>
    <strong>the world and those who dwell in it</strong>
    !
    <br/>
    Let the rivers clap their hands;
    <br/>
    let the hills sing for joy together
    <br/>
    before the Lord, <strong>for he comes</strong>
    <br/>
    <strong> to judge the earth.</strong>
    <br/>
    <strong>He will judge the world with righteousness,</strong>
    <br/>
    <strong> and the peoples with equity.</strong>
    </blockquote>
<p>
    It is vital to notice that the joyful rejoicing occurs because of God’s
    judgment. It is also critical to notice that this joy is universal and
    inextricably tied to the fact that God himself has worked salvation by his
    own hand such that all the ends of the earth have experienced it. It is
    quite reasonable to believe that everyone will rejoice in God’s righteous,
    equitable judgment that results in salvation for all. It is not reasonable
    to believe that everyone will rejoice at God’s judgment if most of them are
    tormented forever and remain in a perpetual state of hatred toward God, as
    many hell theorists suggest.
</p>
<h4>
    The Necessity of Justice
</h4>
<p>
    The accusation that the salvation of all people denies God’s justice or
    ability to judge is false. Instead, God’s justice is a key concept in this
    worldview. An oft-cited passage* to show the necessity of divine justice
    comes from the Croatian theologian Miroslav Volf, who “watched in horror as
    nearly a quarter of a million people died in Bosnia and Croatia and two
    million were left exiled or displaced” during the bloody civil war of the
    1990s (Volf and Tippett, 2005 Interview). It describes the necessity of
    justice in our world:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		If God were not angry at injustice and deception and did not make the final
    end to violence God would not be worthy of our worship. Here, however, I am
    less interested in arguing that God’s violence is not unworthy of God than
    in showing that it is beneficial to us … the fact that in a world of
    violence we are faced with an inescapable alternative: either God’s
    violence or human violence …
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
    My thesis that the practice of nonviolence requires a belief in divine
    vengeance will be unpopular with many Christians, especially theologians in
    the West. To the person who is inclined to dismiss it, I suggest imagining
    that you are delivering a lecture in a war zone (which is where a paper
    that underlies this chapter was originally delivered). Among your listeners
    are people whose cities and villages have been first plundered, then burned
    and leveled to the ground, whose daughters and sisters have been raped,
    whose fathers and brothers have had their throats slit. The topic of the
    lecture: a Christian attitude toward violence. The thesis: we should not
    retaliate since God is perfect noncoercive love. Soon you would discover
    that it takes the quiet of a suburban home for the birth of the thesis that
    human nonviolence corresponds to God’s refusal to judge. In a scorched
    land, soaked in the blood of the innocent, it will invariably die. And as
    one watches it die, one will do well to reflect about many other pleasant
    captivities of the liberal mind. (Exclusion and Embrace by Miroslav Volf
    pgs. 303-304, cited by Vanderklay)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Miroslav Volf’s thesis is essentially that divine justice must occur or
    people will inevitably seek to obtain justice on their own, through
    vengeance. He also concludes that a God who did not judge and “make a final
    end to violence” would not be worthy of our worship and that it is a
    liberal fantasy that God would not judge atrocities. Such a fantasy can
    only exist in a place where such atrocities are distant and unrelatable, in
    the quiet of suburban homes and Starbucks-saturated neighborhoods with
    white picket fences.
</p>
<p>
    Let me begin by saying that I think that Volf’s conclusions are quite
    reasonable. What I disagree with is the persistent insistence by many that
    the sort of “justice” required of God aligns with the popular conception of
    many churches - namely, that every sin merits eternal punishment and that
    all non-believers in Christ in this life will experience this consequence.
    This sort of “justice” ultimately is profoundly <em>unjust</em> and does
    nothing to curb human vengeance. To see why, a little instruction on the
    Yugoslav wars that Volf is alluding to, is in order.
</p>
<h4>
    The Yugoslav Wars
</h4>
<p>
    The Yugoslav Wars were largely due to ethnic and religious tensions in the
    region formerly known as Yugoslavia following the collapse of the Soviet
    Union. The three primary ethnic/religious groups in the conflict were the
    Serbs (primarily Orthodox Christians), the Croats (primarily Catholic
    Christians), and Muslims (sometimes referred to as Bosniaks). Citing
    information from the United Human Rights Council, Wikipedia describes the
    conflicts as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Often described as Europe's deadliest conflicts since World War II, the
    wars were marked by many war crimes, including ethnic cleansing, crimes
    against humanity and rape. The Bosnian genocide was the first European
    crime since World War II to be formally judged as genocidal in character
    and many key individual participants were subsequently charged with war
    crimes ("Yugoslav Wars" 2018).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The brutality of these conflicts is indeed hard to imagine. The United
    Nations Commission on Human Rights “observed that practices of "ethnic
    cleansing", sexual assault and rape appear to represent the implementation
    of policy” ("UN Commission on Human Rights - Report on Human Rights
    Situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina” 1995). The apparent goal of the policy
    of setting up “rape camps” (in which thousands of women were repeatedly
    raped) was ethnic cleansing, forcing these women to become pregnant and
    give birth to half-Serbian children. It also served to “destroy cultural
    and social ties of the victims and their communities” ("Yugoslav Wars"
    2018).
</p>
<p>
    Massacres of unarmed individuals and the resultant mass graves are 
	well-known events of these conflicts as well.<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18101028">The Srebrenica massacre
    </a>
    , for example, involved the execution of “7,000-8,000 Muslim men and boys
    by Bosnian Serb forces in a Bosnian town that had been designated a United
    Nations safe haven” (Theodorou 2015). The Foča ethnic cleansing campaign
    lasted nearly two years and involved many crimes against humanity,
    including systematic expulsion of Bosniaks from Foča, “killings, mass
    rapes, and the deliberate destruction of Bosniak property and cultural
    sites.” The number missing or killed from Foča as a result of this
    monstrous campaign is over 2,700 people ("Foča ethnic cleansing" 2018).
</p>
<p>
    So, Dr. Volf is correct in asserting that justice must be done. But here is
    the really important thing to understand. Although there certainly was
suffering on all sides in these wars,    <em>most of the victims of the atrocities discussed above were Muslims</em>. Muslim Bosniak women were the ones being raped repeatedly. Muslims were
    the victims of the Srebrenica massacre and the Foča “ethnic cleansing.” Not
    only this, the perpetrators of these horrible atrocities were the Serbs,
    who identified themselves as Christians!
</p>
<p>
    In what sense, it must be asked then, is it <em>just</em> for the Muslim
    victims to share the same hell as their supposedly “Christian” assailants,
    simply because they did not claim Jesus as their Savior before being
    murdered? Or worse yet, be consigned to hell, while the rapists and killers
    who victimized them go to heaven for claiming Christ? Where is the justice
    in that?
</p>
<p>
    The absurdity and double-minded inconsistency of claiming that justice will
    be served by sending all non-believers to endless torment is
    well-illustrated in a sermon by Mark Clark, founder and pastor of Village
    Church in Canada. In this sermon, he is preaching that all non-Christians
    will be consigned to endless hell and attempting to explain why this is
    just. In this context, after quoting Miroslav Volf’s view of the necessity
    of justice, he says one of the most incredibly absurd statements I’ve ever
    heard. Remember, he says the following statement as part of his effort
    <em>
        to prove his point that it would be just for all unbelievers to go to
        eternal hell</em>. Here it is:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Listen, ask <em>a Muslim</em> and <em>a Jew</em> how excited they are that
    everyone’s just going to go to heaven when they die, and all the
    grandparents and the friends and the history that they lost their lives
    fighting for truth, and monotheism, and election, and the idea that this
    land wasn’t yours and I’m going to fight. Don’t worry everyone, we’re all
    just going to be in heaven. Don’t worry about all that stuff that your
    parents died for; it was all false anyway. God’s just going to bring
    everybody into heaven. Ask people who actually live in the midst of pain
    and awfulness. But it does take a suburban life to come up with the idea
    that hell would somehow be unjust." (<em>The Problem of Hell</em> video
    sermon. Quote begins around minute 23:30)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The supreme irony of this blather is that <em>he </em>is claiming that
    those Muslims and Jews who lost their lives <em>really did</em> die for
    nothing, that their views <em>really are false</em>, and that they will
    <em>
        suffer the same fate of eternal punishment as those who committed
        atrocities against them</em>! He does not believe that Muslims and Jews are going to heaven since they
    are unbelievers! In keeping with the core beliefs of his church, he asserts
    “the everlasting, conscious punishment of the unbeliever” ("Our Core
    Beliefs"). It seems as if he is completely unaware of the implications of
    what he is saying. But we cannot really blame him – his argument seems to
    come from other sources I’ve read, who thoughtfully left off his “ask a
    Muslim and a Jew” flourish.
</p>
<p>
    But since he brought it up, maybe we should also ask a Muslim and a Jew if
    they view it as <em>just</em> that all of them will be tormented forever
    alongside their enemies (or worse yet, apart from their enemies who are
    experiencing eternal bliss for claiming to be Christians)! Maybe we should
    ask Muslims how just it is that they suffered execution and rape at the
    hands of “Christian” Serbs, only to end up in eternal misery for not being
    Christians themselves. It is hardly surprising that the women who were
    repeatedly gang-raped in those conflicts by supposed “Christians” did not
    come running to Jesus as their Savior. The “lights of the world” that they
    were exposed to certainly did not shine brightly or represent Christ well.
</p>
<h4>
    Nazism
</h4>
<p>
    Or perhaps we can consider the impression left by “Christians” on the Jews
    in Nazi Germany. It is no secret that Nazi propaganda painted the
    extirpation of Jewish people as a Christian duty. Consider the following
    quotes from Adolf Hitler:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the
    Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for
    the work of the Lord.” (<em>Mein Kampf</em>, p. 65)
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“The National Government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to
    revive in the nation the spirit of unity and cooperation. It will preserve
    and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built. It
    regards Christianity as the foundation of our national morality, and the
    family as the basis of national life." - Speech delivered at Berlin 1
February 1933; from <cite>Adolf Hitler (1941). My New Order</cite>    <cite>. New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock. p. 144. (Retrieved from </cite>

	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“It must be at this point established that there are ten thousands and ten
    thousands of priests of all Christian Confessions who perform their
    ecclesiastical duties just as well as of probably better than the political
    agitators without ever coming into conflict with the laws of the State. To
    protect these the State regards as its task; the destruction of the enemies
    of the State it regards as its duty.” -
    <a href="http://comicism.tripod.com/390130.html">
        Speech delivered at the Reichstag 30 January 1939
    </a>
; from <cite>Norman H. Baynes, ed. (1969). The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922-August 1939</cite>    <cite>. <strong>1</strong>. New York: Howard Fertig. pp. 398-399.</cite>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    So, you see, Nazi Germany viewed itself as “Christian.” It also viewed the
    destruction of the Jews, who were considered “enemies of the state,” as a
    duty (and many thousands of “Christian” priests said nothing to contradict
    these claims). Are we really to believe that these millions of Jews who
    were sent to concentration camps, tortured, experimented on, and murdered
    will be sent to hell forever for not believing in a Christ whose
    “followers” represented these atrocities as virtuous Christian duty? And
    then are we to have the <em>audacity</em> to ask them what they think of
    the “justice” of this hell? What absolute drivel!
</p>
<h4>
    The Slave Trade
</h4>
<p>
    The number of examples of incomprehensible injustice that would result from
    the traditional hell doctrine could be enumerated <em>ad nauseum</em>, but
    for now we will just discuss one more. The African slave trade was, by all
    accounts, a brutal business in which Africans were kidnapped from their
    homes, savagely mistreated, and enslaved. Here is a description of a slave
    ship from a BBC article:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Ships carried anything from 250 to 600 slaves. They were generally very
    overcrowded. In many ships they were packed like spoons, with no room even
    to turn, although in some ships a slave could have a space about five feet
    three inches high and four feet four inches wide. The slaves were kept
    between the hold and the deck in appalling conditions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Olaudah Equiano gave the first eyewitness account of life on a ship from a
    slave's point of view.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a
    salutation in my nostrils as I had never experienced in my life: so that,
    with the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying together, I became so sick
    and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the least desire to taste
    anything. I now wished for the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon,
    to my grief, two of the white men offered me eatables; and on my refusing
    to eat, one of them held me fast by the hands and laid me across I think
    the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me severely.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I had never seen among any people such instances of brutal cruelty; and
    this not only shewn towards us blacks, but also some of the white
    themselves. One white man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be
    on deck, flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that
    he died in consequence of it."
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This same source discusses accounts of “rebellious slaves being tortured by
    having hands, arms and legs cut off, on order of the captain as a lesson to
    the rest of the slaves, and of women being attacked and disfigured.” It
    also quotes Alexander Falconbridge, (who served as a surgeon aboard slave
    ships and later became the governor of a British colony for freed slaves in
    Sierra Leone) on the appalling conditions on slave ships:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"... the excessive heat was not the only thing that rendered their
    situation intolerable. The deck, that is the floor of their rooms, was so
    covered with the blood and mucus which had proceeded from them in
    consequence of the flux, that it resembled a slaughterhouse."
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In addition, many slaves died during the journey:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“It's estimated that an average of twenty percent of slaves were lost in
    transit, and as many as half the slaves have been known to die in one
    journey.” ("BBC World Service | The Story of Africa")
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Most of these horribly mistreated people were likely polytheists or perhaps
    Muslims since these were common religions in Africa during this time period
    (Sambol-Tosco 2004).&nbsp; It is highly doubtful that many were
    Christians and most of their exposure to “Christians” would have been
    contact with slave traders and other exploitative, oppressive Europeans. Is
    it <em>justice</em> that these Africans be sent to eternal conscious
    torment, while the men who kidnapped, mutilated, and sold them enter into
    eternal bliss for being “Christian”? We know of at least one former slave
    trader who became Christian: John Newton, writer of the extremely popular
    hymn, <em>Amazing Grace</em>, was captain of a slave ship prior to
    repenting of this terrible practice. I do not doubt his salvation or the
    sincerity of his repentance, nor am I claiming that he must be punished for
    past sins. But it must be asked whether it can truly be called “justice”
    for him to experience no post-mortem consequences while those whom he was
    party to grievously mistreating end up in further never-ending torment. Is
    that really justice?
</p>
<p>
    Of course, the atrocities of Serbian war criminals, Nazis, and slave
    traders do not represent authentic faith in Christ at all. This horrible
    treatment of human beings is clearly morally wrong and ignores Jesus’ clear
    commands to love our neighbors and even our enemies. Nevertheless, these
    people <em>claimed</em> to represent Jesus and surely maligned the gospel
    to many, so that they would not come to faith. Will God do worse than these
    evil men by tormenting people for all eternity simply because they did not
    understand and believe the gospel before death, even though the message
    they received was no gospel at all?
</p>
<p>
    To help answer this, we should reconsider Miroslav Volf's ideas on justice, 
	and ask the appropriate questions: Whose innocent blood soaked the
    decks, the fields, and the concentration camp floors? Whose land and
    property was scorched? Who was raped and whose throats were slit? In the
    examples we have discussed, the victims were Muslims and polytheists, not
    Christians. And what about human trafficking victims or impoverished Hindus
    who never come to know Christ? How is justice served by condemning all of
    these victims to eternal punishment? The answer, of course, is that it is
    not.
</p>
<p>
    As a final point, Volf claims that a God who did not "make the final end to
    violence" would not be worthy of our worship. Does endless hell in which
    countless human beings dwell in perpetual hatred of one another and of God
    satisfy this condition? Of course not! Violence and evil never, ever end in
    such a scenario. There is no resolution.&nbsp; But true justice is not like 
	that.&nbsp; God will truly resolve the problem, not just sweep it under the 
	rug.</p>
	<h4>Biblical Justice</h4>
	<p>Biblical justice is <em>not revenge</em>.&nbsp; It is making things 
	right.&nbsp; </p>
	<h3>Isaiah 1:17</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.</blockquote>
	<h3>Zechariah 7:9-10</h3>
	<blockquote>
		This is what the Lord Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show 
	mercy and compassion to one another.&nbsp; Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’</blockquote>
	<p>Notice that<em> true justice</em> is doing what is right <em>by showing 
	mercy and compassion</em>, especially as 
	it relates to the treatment of the poor, the disadvantaged, and the 
	oppressed.&nbsp; With this in mind, what would truly make things right for a 
	poor widow with no livelihood because her land was confiscated by greedy men 
	after her husband's death: restoration of her land and livelihood or watching those men tortured?  What would make things right for an orphan who is exploited by corrupt slaveholders: being set free and experiencing the true love of a loving family or getting empty revenge?  And what of the Bosniak men, women, and children (or people of any ethnicity) who suffered 
	the atrocities of war?  In all of these circumstances, it is clear that the only 
	<em>just</em> outcome is restoration of all that was lost and healing of all that was broken.  
Revenge solves nothing.  It does not bring the dead back to life.  It does not restore dignity or relationships.  It does not heal the festering wounds of humanity.  But God does.  That is His justice, and that is why He is worthy of worship, doing what we never could.  
<p>In addition to restoration, true justice is inextricably tied to mercy, compassion, love, and salvation.<h3>Hosea 2:19 
	</h3>
	<blockquote>
		I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, in love and compassion.</blockquote>
	<h3>Isaiah 30:18</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise up to show you compassion. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him!</blockquote>
	<h3>Isaiah 56:1 </h3>
	<blockquote>
		This is what the Lord says: “Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed.</blockquote>
	<h3>Isaiah 51:5</h3>
	<blockquote>
		My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the 
	way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to 
	me and wait in hope for my arm.</blockquote>
<p>It is because the Lord is a God of justice that He will be gracious and show compassion.  It is because of His salvation that we too should be just and merciful as He is just and merciful.  This salvation is for all and is why the islands (other nations and people groups outside of Israel) look to God and hope in His arm that brings justice.  God's justice is not a bludgeon to beat down those who doubt or those who are enslaved by sin; it is light and salvation for all people.  As stated by God in Isaiah 51:4-5, instruction and illumination are the purposes for His justice: “Listen to me, my people; hear me, my nation: Instruction 
	will go out from me; my justice will become a light to the nations." Isaiah 26:9 reinforces this illuminating purpose of justice, saying  that when God's "judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness." </p>	
	<p>In what is often considered a messianic prophecy, God describes His 
	servant (Christ) who "will bring justice to the nations" (Isaiah 42:1) as 
	follows:&nbsp; </p>

	<h3>Isaiah 42:3-7</h3>
	<blockquote>
		"A bruised reed he will not break,
    and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.
In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;
he will not falter or be discouraged
till he establishes justice on earth.
    In his teaching the islands will put their hope.”&nbsp; This is what God the Lord says—
the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out,
    who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it,
    who gives breath to its people,
    and life to those who walk on it:&nbsp; “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness;
    I will take hold of your hand.
I will keep you and will make you
    to be a covenant for the people
    and a light for the Gentiles,
to open eyes that are blind,
    to free captives from prison
    and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.</blockquote>
	<p>Notice the gentleness and patience of Christ, the servant who faithfully 
	establishes justice throughout the earth. In this establishment of justice, 
	He does not break those who are bruised by life's cruelties.&nbsp; Nor does 
	He snuff out those whose doubts and fears have stolen their light so that 
	they are only smoldering wicks that no longer experience the flame of God's 
	love in their hearts. No, instead His justice opens blind eyes, frees 
	captives, and releases those who are trapped in dungeons of darkness. His 
	justice seeks and saves the lost, making all new, making all wrongs right. 
	Any theology of justice that reduces this beautiful picture to mere <em>
	revenge</em>, or that pits God's love against God's justice is a shameful 
	caricature that is unworthy of God. Love and justice are not antithetical; 
	love is God's very nature and the impetus that drives His restorative 
	justice. This is why Psalm 96:13 can say, "Let all creation rejoice before 
	the Lord, <em>for</em> he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge 
	the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness." <br><br>
	Justice, properly understood is truly something that all creation (which 
	obviously includes all people) will rejoice in.&nbsp; Indeed, it is the 
	reason given by the Psalmist for <em>why everyone and everything will 
	rejoice</em>. </p>
	
<h4>
    Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
    The necessity of justice in our world does not in any way support the
    conclusion that hell should be eternal. This interpretation of "justice" so
    often paraded about in churches bears no resemblance to actual justice, but
    instead results in horrible <em>injustice</em>. While Volf may be correct
    in saying that "it takes the quiet of a suburban home" to believe that God
    will not judge evil, it is equally true that it takes the prejudice and 
	historical ignorance of such
    a life to arrive at the conclusion that all nonbelievers deserve eternal
    torment, no matter what injustices and evils they experienced. What right
    do we have to judge the unbelief of another person whose entire life has
    been one of suffering (the likes of which we have never experienced)? Can
    we really assert, having grown up in Christian homes or cultures with
    incredible privilege, that people do not believe because they just want to
    go on sinning? What if the only exposure they had to "Christians" was being
    raped, enslaved, or murdered by them? What if the only "evidence" of God
    they have experienced is the cold asphalt of a smog-saturated slum where
    they have been sold as sex slaves since childhood without ever even hearing
    the gospel?

    If evil and suffering continue indefinitely, and the victims are punished
    with the same sentence as the perpetrators of cruelties, then God truly
    would be unjust and fail to put an end to violence. In short, if the
    traditional hell doctrine were true, <em>then </em>God would not be worthy
    of worship by Volf's standards. It is the god of eternal conscious torment
    who fails to bring justice to the world. Such a god is not worthy of
    worship.

<p>
    True justice fixes the problem of violence, cruelty and oppression
    permanently, not by consigning most of the human race to eternal misery and
    hatred toward Him and one another, but by restoring each person to a right
    relationship with Him and with one another. Wickedness dies because it is
    replaced by righteousness. Violence dies because it is replaced by love.
    This belief that God will ultimately restore all people does not deny God's
    justice. Evil is still punished, but it is punished fairly. Rapists and
    murderers do not experience the same unending punishment as their victims.
    Instead everyone is judged according to what they have done, as the Bible
    repeatedly describes, and receives the appropriate discipline that fully cleanses them
    of all unrighteousness as they recognize their wrongdoing in light of God’s
    perfect holiness and love. But this good purpose in no way denies the fact
    that the wicked should shudder about the judgment that awaits them if they
    persist in doing evil. It is still a “fearful thing to fall into the hands
    of the living God” after a life of unrepentant wickedness (Hebrews 10:31).
    Nevertheless, though the cleansing treatment is painful, the disease of sin
    and death is cured permanently when all are subjected to Christ and God is
    all in all (1 Corinthians 15:28). In this sane, perfect, restorative judgment, we can
    truly rejoice along with all of creation.
