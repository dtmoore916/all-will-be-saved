<h2>
    <u>Prioritizing a System</u>
</h2>
<p>
    A few months ago, I participated in a class at a local church on different
    views of hell in which universal salvation, eternal conscious torment, and
    a version of conditional immortality (annihilationism) were discussed. It
    was a good class that allowed participants to consider each of these views,
    which is hopefully something that churches will continue to do. One of the
    resources given to participants by the presenter of eternal conscious
    torment was an article by Thomas R. Schreiner entitled
    <em>
        “Problematic Texts” for Definite Atonement in the Pastoral and General
        Epistles
    </em>
    . In this essay, Schreiner attempts to defend the Calvinist doctrine of
    limited atonement, which contends that Jesus’ sacrifice only atoned for
    some people (the elect), and that it was only intended to atone for those
    people, not for the rest of the world. In other words, God chose to save
    the elect and to condemn the rest to hell prior to any actions on their
    parts. Your eternal destiny, and the eternal destinies of all people, were
    pre-determined by God before the foundation of the world. This
    deterministic view, of course, inevitably means that God chose to damn most
    of humanity to eternal conscious suffering before anyone was even born and
    only chose to save relatively few. This view is fundamental to the
    theological system of thought known as Calvinism, which is often summarized
    with the acronym TULIP (in which the “L” stands for limited atonement).
</p>
<p>
    In order to defend this system, Schreiner has to deal with what he calls
    “problematic texts” (i.e. texts that don’t fit the system because they
    contradict it). The way he goes about doing this is very interesting and
    telling. We will not go into every “problematic” text that he addresses for
    the sake of time. Instead we will focus on how he deals with 1 Timothy
    4:10, which states that “we have our hope set on the living God, who is the
    Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.” Since this verse
    claims that God is the Savior of <em>all people</em> it is clearly
    “problematic” for the limited atonement camp. Interestingly, Schreiner’s
    approach is not to directly explain his view, but rather to give a survey
    of two of the different ways that Calvinists have attempted to get around
    the clear meaning of the text. He then, with good reason, rejects both of
    these, before proposing his own view. Here are the “workarounds” he
    discusses:
</p>
<h4>
    1. Especially does not mean especially
</h4>
<p>
    He begins like this:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“One aspect of the debate centers on the meaning of the word μάλιστα [<em>malista</em>]. The ESV translates the word “especially,” as do
    virtually all English translations. In 1979, however, T. C. Skeat argued
    that μάλιστα should be translated “namely,” or “that is.” Skeat defended
    his case by citing some examples from Greek papyrus letters, and then with
    a few NT examples.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    After spending a short time mentioning some of this “evidence,” he honestly
    admits that “the notion that μάλιστα means “that is” or “namely” should be
    rejected.” He decides, in agreement with another scholar, that “Skeat’s
    readings are either ambiguous and therefore not proven, or they are
    mistaken” and “in every instance that Skeat’s rendering is unpersuasive.”
    He decides, in other words, that translating the verse differently would be
    a major mistake and cannot be justified. He concludes as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		In conclusion, then, there is little doubt that μάλιστα means “especially”
    instead of “that is” or “namely” in 1 Timothy 4:10. Naturally the
    translation “that is” would appear to fit nicely with definite atonement,
    for then the verse would teach that God is the Savior of all people, that
    is, believers. The “all people” would be defined as believers, and thus
    there would be no sense that God universally saves all people. Lexically,
    however, this interpretation is quite implausible and hence it should be
    rejected. The ESV translates the verse well: God “is the Savior of all
    people, especially of those who believe.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In short, <em>malista</em> really does mean “especially” and attempting to
    deny this fact is futile. So, even though this would solve the “problem”
    that God is “the Savior of all people” for a Calvinist, Schreiner honestly
    admits that it is unsupportable, and for that honesty he should be
    commended. Of course, the idea should have never been proposed in the first
    place since it is clearly ridiculous to say “all people, <em>that is</em>
    only some people.”
</p>
<h4>
    2. Savior does not mean Savior
</h4>
<p>
    Next, Schreiner discusses an attempt to redefine what it means for God to
    be Savior:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Steven Baugh proposes an interpretation that appears to solve any dilemma
    for a Reformed position on definite atonement. He argues that the word
    “Savior” here does not refer to spiritual salvation, “but to God’s gracious
    benefactions to all of humanity,” or, “to God’s care for all of humanity
    during our time upon earth.” Baugh notes many examples in Greco-Roman
    literature, and especially in Ephesian inscriptions, where Savior refers to
    the protection and preservation granted by kings, emperors, patrons, and
    other leaders.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    So, in this view, God is the Savior of all people, not spiritually, but in
    terms of “common grace.” He let’s us live on earth, provides people in
    general with the necessities of life (although for many this would be
    debatable) and has not destroyed us yet. Schreiner spends some time
    explaining how this would solve the problem for his camp, since then it
    would be possible to still have most people go to hell while calling God
    their “Savior.” He is, however, to be commended once again for rejecting
    this superficial false explanation. He does quite a thorough job refuting
    it, so I will quote him at length (removing his Greek references for
    readability):
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that Baugh’s interpretation is correct,
    for there is a crucial problem with his interpretation. One of the major
    themes in the Pastoral Epistles is salvation. Paul refers to both God and
    Christ as “Savior” and uses the verb “save” seven times (1 Tim. 1:15; 2:4,
    15; 4:16; 2 Tim. 1:9; 4:18; Titus 3:5). God is identified as “Savior” six
    times in the Pastorals (1 Tim. 1:1; 2:3 4:10; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4) and
    Christ four times (2 Tim. 1:10; Titus 1:4; 2:13; 3:6). The noun “salvation”
    is used twice (2 Tim. 2:10; 3:15), and the adjective “bringing salvation”
    once (Titus 2:11).
    <strong>
        What is striking is that there is not a single instance in the
        Pastorals where the salvation word group refers to anything besides
        spiritual salvation.
    </strong>
    In other words, the term <strong>never</strong> means preservation, nor
    does it focus on material blessings. A survey of some examples will confirm
    this judgment.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In 1 Timothy 1:1, God as Savior is connected with the hope that belongs to
    believers in Christ, which makes it clear that spiritual salvation is in
    view. It is even clearer that spiritual salvation is intended in 1 Timothy
    2:3–4, for God “our Savior” is the one “who desires all people to be
    saved.” Then Paul proceeds to speak of Christ as the “Mediator”, so there
    is no doubt that salvation from sin is the subject. A reference to
    spiritual salvation is evident in 1 Timothy 1:15: “Christ Jesus came into
    the world to save sinners.” Similarly, in 2 Timothy 1:10, Christ is
    identified as Savior, as the one “who abolished death and brought life and
    immortality to light through the gospel.” The references to conquering
    death and the dawn of life through the gospel confirm a reference to
    spiritual salvation. In 2 Timothy 2:10, “salvation” is linked with
    obtaining “eternal glory.” The Scriptures lead to “salvation through faith
    in Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 3:15). So too, the Lord will “save” Paul “into his
    heavenly kingdom” (2 Tim. 4:18). God and Christ are both identified as
    Savior in the introduction of Titus (1:3–4), and spiritual salvation is
    clearly in view, since in the context Paul refers to “God’s elect”,
    “knowledge of the truth” (v. 1), “eternal life” (v. 2), his “preaching” (v.
    3), and “common faith” (v. 4). In Titus 2:10, God as “Savior” is linked
    with his bringing “salvation for all people” (v. 11) and “waiting for our
    blessed hope” (v. 13) of the coming of Christ as “God and Savior.” Both God
    and Christ are identified as Savior in Titus 3:4–6, and this is linked with
    the truth that God “saved us” (v. 5).
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Lexically, then, there is little doubt that Paul refers to spiritual
    salvation in 1 Timothy 4:10. Surprisingly, Baugh does not consider how
    “salvation” and “Savior” are used elsewhere in the Pastorals, and
    <strong>
        he wrongly resorts to how the word is used in inscriptions in Ephesus
        instead of relying on the nearer and more important context—the Pauline
        usage in the Pastoral Epistles
    </strong>
    . A reference to spiritual salvation is confirmed by the context in which
    verse 10 appears. Paul explicitly contrasts spiritual and physical training
    (vv. 7–8), prizing the former over the latter. Indeed, spiritual training
    is paramount, for it provides benefit both “for the present life and also
    for the life to come” (v. 9). The reference to “the life to come” indicates
    that spiritual salvation is intended.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In conclusion, Baugh’s interpretation is <strong>creative</strong> and
    solves the problem before us,

        but it fails lexically and does not account well for the meaning of

<p>
    In summary, Baugh’s “creative” solution completely ignores the biblical
    context of the word Savior. Instead, he resorts to using pagan inscriptions
    to redefine the biblical concept in a way that is completely inconsistent
    with both the immediate and broader biblical context. Paul’s discussion of
    salvation in the Pastoral Epistles is always in reference to spiritual
    salvation and never means what Baugh is claiming. It is doubtful that it
    would be possible to find a single instance of the word “Savior” in the
    entire New Testament that could be used to support Baugh’s idea. In short,
    his interpretation is simply a failed attempt to evade the clear meaning of
    the text in context through the use of extraneous information from a
    different, unrelated context. It is simply unreasonable.

<h4>
    Schreiner’s Honest Assessments
</h4>
<p>
    Before we go on to consider Schreiner’s own interpretation of 1 Timothy
    4:10, it is critical to notice that he, as a Calvinist himself, is refuting
    other Calvinists quite decisively, even though he admits that their
    interpretations would allow him to hold to his doctrine. The explanations
    proposed by these other men are so clearly wrong that he cannot, in good
    conscience, promote them, even though it would be in his interest to do so.
    Again, this is commendable, but it goes to show the incredible lengths that
    some of his fellow Calvinists have gone to in order to promote their views.
</p>
<h4>
    3. Schreiner’s “Explanation”
</h4>
<p>
    We will now analyze and dissect Schreiner’s own interpretation of 1 Timothy
    4:10 and we will see that he does not really do any better than his
    predecessors at defending limited atonement. His attempt is rather
    convoluted and requires one to accept multiple contradictory statements. I
    will first quote his entire explanation, and then break it down to show its
    inconsistency:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The phrase “God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved” (2:3b–4a)
    shares the same conceptual horizon with “the living God, who is the Savior
    of all people” (4:10b–c) and refers to God’s salvific desire toward all
    kinds of people—in this sense God avails himself as Savior to all kinds of
    individuals from diverse people groups. The phrase “to come to the
    knowledge of the truth” (2:4b) mirrors “especially . . . those who believe”
    (4:10d), showing that salvation is a reality only for those who come to the
    knowledge of the truth through faith. It seems, then, that Paul is saying
    here that God is potentially the Savior of all kinds of people—in that, as
    the living God there is no other Savior available to people—but that he is
    actually the Savior of only believers. The additional comment, “especially
    of believers,” intensifies the meaning of salvation. The possibility of God
    being a Savior for all kinds of people exists because there is only one
    living God (4:10b) and one Mediator available to people (2:5–6), but this
    possibility becomes a reality for those who believe. The phrase clarifies
    that believers are a subset of all people; they are a special category
    because they are actually saved.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		But does such an interpretation disprove definite atonement? In the first
    place, this interpretation should not be confused with one that suggests
    two levels to the atonement: Christ dies for everyone to make them
    redeemable, and he dies for the elect to actually redeem them. This
    introduces an unwarranted split-level into the atonement. The issue in 1
    Timothy 4:10 is not two levels to the atonement, but rather the twin truths
    that God (the Father) is the available Savior for all kinds of people—God’s
    salvific stance—while at the same time being the actual Savior for only
    those who believe (in Christ).
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Secondly, 1 Timothy 4:10 illustrates that definite atonement may be
    affirmed alongside other biblical truths, such as God’s salvific stance to
    the world and the possibility for people to be saved if they believe in
    Christ. Those who hold to a definite intention in the atonement to save
    only the elect also believe that God desires people to be saved (1 Tim.
    2:3–4; cf. Ezek. 18:32), that he is available as Savior to all people (1
    Tim. 4:10), that Christ’s death is sufficient for the salvation of every
    person, and that all are invited to be saved on the basis of Christ’s death
    for sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). But it is a non sequitur to suggest that
    affirming any of these biblical truths somehow negates the truth that
    Christ intended to die only for his elect, actually paying for their sins
    alone. In biblical soteriology, these theological elements sit side by
    side.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Perhaps you read that quote and thought “what is this guy talking about?”
Don’t worry, it isn’t you; it’s him. The reason why the passage    <em>seems confusing</em> is because it <em>is confusing</em>. But rather
    than simply assume that he must be smarter than the rest of us and
    therefore understands some deeper mystery that we can’t, we will now
    proceed to dissect his claims.
</p>
<h4>
    Claim 1: The connection between 1 Timothy 2:3-4 and 1 Timothy 4:10 negates
    the statement that God is the “Savior of all people.”
</h4>
<p>
    The claim that the two verses are related is reasonable. What is
    unreasonable is his interpretation that this therefore means that only
    those who have a knowledge of the truth presently will be saved. He is
    saying that those who “have the knowledge of the truth” in 1 Timothy 2:4
    are “those who believe” in 1 Timothy 4:10. This, however, does nothing to
    change the fact that 1 Timothy 4:10 is saying that God is “the Savior of
    all people, especially of those who believe” or especially of those who
    “have the knowledge of the truth.” In essence, he is making the exact same
    error as the one by Skeat that he refutes: he is redefining “especially” to
    mean “that is” by saying that God is really only the actual Savior of those
    who believe and have a knowledge of the truth, not of all people (i.e. God
    is the Savior of all people, <em>that is</em> those who believe). This is
    clear because he is denying that God is actually the Savior of all people;
    instead his salvation only counts for those who believe, so he is
    redefining “all people” as those who believe (making the same error he
    refutes in Skeats’ work).
</p>
<h4>
    Claim 2: God is only <em>potentially</em> the Savior of all <em>kinds</em>
    of people.
</h4>
<p>
    There are two glaring problems with this claim. The first is that it
    changes God from an <em>actual</em> Savior to only a <em>potential</em>
    Savior. Paul does not say “potential Savior” for a reason: that is not what
    he means. If the title of “Savior” really means “potential Savior” then we
    have no assurance that God will <em>actually</em> save anyone, not even
    believers. The verse does not say “potential Savior” and there is no
    contextual reason to assume this meaning. To do so opens the door to
    interpreting any reference to Jesus as Savior in this way, in which case he
    does not necessarily save anyone. Besides being exegetically absurd and
    denying God’s sovereignty, such a view is deeply contrary to the Calvinist
    ideology that Schreiner is purporting to defend.
</p>
<p>
    The second problem with his claim is that he just inserts, without any
clear justification, the idea that God only saves all “<em>kinds</em>”    <em> </em>of people. Again, the text does not say this, and there is no
    contextual reason to assume it. If we can just insert random words into the
    biblical text whenever we like, we can make it say whatever we want! If
    Paul wanted to say “all kinds of people” he certainly could have done so.
There are several words in Greek that mean type or kind. He could have used <em><a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1085.htm">genos</a></em> (γένος), or    <em><a href="http://biblehub.com/str/greek/1491.htm">eidos</a></em>
    (εἶδος), or he could have said that God was the Savior of all ethnicities
or races (<em><a href="http://biblehub.com/str/greek/1484.htm">ethnos</a></em>/ἔθνος)
    instead of all people/mankind. He did not, however, say any of those
    things. Why do we arrive at Paul’s writings with the preconceived notion
    that he could not possibly mean what he said (because they don’t fit a
    particular theological system developed in the 16<sup>th</sup> century!),
    and therefore assume that he meant to say something else? We should not
    assume him to be so incompetent a writer as to repeatedly make the mistake
    of saying “all” but really meaning “all kinds of.”
</p>
<h4>
    Claim 3: The additional comment, “especially of believers,” intensifies the
    meaning of salvation.
</h4>
<p>
    This is a very odd claim. Here’s why:
</p>
<p>
    1. The phrasing used in 1 Timothy 4:10 is that God is the “Savior of all
    people”
</p>
<p>
    2. Schreiner is claiming that only believers will be saved, <em>not</em>
    all people, so he is simply denying that God will save all people, not
    intensifying the meaning of salvation.
</p>
<p>
    Put another way, he is saying that God is “<em>not</em> the Savior of all
    people” but that adding the phrase “especially of believers” causes the
    word Savior to actually mean Savior (whereas before it did not since he
    does not save all people). This is really just a nonsensical claim. The
    meaning of the word “Savior” is not intensified by denying what it means in
    the first place, and then saying that it regains its meaning.
</p>
<h4>
    Claim 4: “God (the Father) is the <em>available</em> Savior for all kinds
of people—God’s salvific stance—while at the same time being the    <em>actual</em> Savior for only those who believe (in Christ).” There is
    the “possibility” of God being the Savior for all “kinds” of people.
</h4>
<p>
    This claim is deeply problematic and logically incoherent. It must be
    remembered that the doctrine of limited atonement that Schreiner is
    defending says that God chose to atone for and save <em>only</em> the
elect. God did not, in this view, atone for anyone else. There is therefore    <em>no possibility</em> that anyone else could be saved or atoned for. God,
    in His sovereign will decided not to save them. He is not “available”
    precisely because He predestined some to be saved and others not to be. It
    is certainly a <em>non sequitur </em>to claim that God’s salvific stance is
    to save all people, but he actually chose before time began to only save a
    small minority. If He deliberately chose <em>not </em>to save all people,
    it is not possible to rationally argue that his salvific stance is to save
    all people; it clearly is not.
</p>
<h4>
    Claim 5: You can hold to definite atonement and a bunch of other
    contradictory ideas at the same time.
</h4>
<p>
    While people do <em>attempt </em>to do this, it is logically incoherent. It
    requires you to affirm the following clearly contradictory ideas at the
    same time:
</p>
<p>
    1. It is possible for anyone to be saved but at the same time it is only
    possible for the elect to be saved.
</p>
<p>
    2. God desires all people to be saved but at the same time His intent in
    the atonement was only to save the elect.
</p>
<p>
    3. Christ is available as Savior to all, but at the same time actually only
    available to the elect (who were chosen before the world began).
</p>
<p>
    4. Christ’s death is sufficient to save everyone, but at the same time is
    not actually sufficient to save everyone (since it fails to do so and is
    only intended for the “elect.”).
</p>
<p>
    5. All are invited to be saved, but actually only the elect are invited to
    be saved (since they are irresistibly drawn to salvation and others are
    not).
</p>
<p>
    No matter how much he claims otherwise, these views cannot actually be held
    side by side with intellectual integrity. They are contradictory. Psalm
    115:3 tells us that “Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he
    pleases.” This verse (and many other verses) tell us that God accomplishes
    his desires. It is contradictory to say that He desires to save all people,
    but refuses to do so even though it is within his power. If I told you that
    I really want to give you $10,000 and I have full power to do so, but I
    decided long ago that I will never, ever give it to you, you would rightly
    call me a liar. You would say that I don’t really want to give you $10,000;
    if I did, I would give it to you since nothing is stopping me. My claim to
    “want” to give you the money is obviously disingenuous. In the same way we
    cannot say that God wants to save all people, but only wants to save some
    whom He chose. He has the power and He does as he pleases.
</p>
<p>
    This is why 1 Timothy 2:6 says that Christ gave himself “as a ransom for
    all.” His desire and purpose was to buy all people back from sin and death,
    not “all kinds of people.” The fact that this is the case is actually
    indisputable and the many efforts made by Calvinists to deny it are futile.
    All of the desperate evasions of the clear meaning of so many texts are
    pointless since the doctrine of limited atonement is directly and
    specifically refuted by the Bible. Rather tellingly, the verse that does so
    most plainly is not addressed at all in Schreiner’s article, or in any that
    I’ve seen so far that purport to defend limited atonement:
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 2:2
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		He is the <strong>atoning sacrifice</strong> for our sins, and    <strong>not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world</strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    I think the reason why Calvinists tend to avoid this verse is because it
    explicitly and unambiguously contradicts the doctrine of limited atonement
    in such a way that evasion is impossible. It is clear that John is saying
that Jesus is the atoning sacrifice not just for believers but also for the    <em>whole world</em>. Of necessity, this is telling us that his atonement
    was not limited to believers but rather pertains to every person, including
    those who are not believers.
</p>
<p>
    Now some may attempt to claim that John was only referring to believers in
    one geographic location and that the whole world could mean believers in
    other places. This claim, however is pure sophistry and cannot be
    supported. 1 John is not addressed to a specific geographic location or
    church. It “was a circular letter sent to Christians in a number of places”
    ("Intro to 1 John" 2016). So, John was clearly referring to Christians
generally when he says that Christ is the atoning sacrifice for    <em>our sins</em>, and clearly referring to the whole world (including
    non-Christians) when he says this sacrifice extends to atone for sins of
    the whole world. Everyone is atoned for by Jesus. He truly ransomed us all.
    1 John 2:2 is a proverbial thermonuclear bomb that utterly obliterates the
    leaky sinking dinghy of limited atonement. With so many other passages of
    Scripture clearly describing God’s intent and desire to save all people, it
    is a wonder that people still so tightly cling to such a doctrine.
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing the system
</h4>
<p>
    The fact that there are so many intellectually inconsistent,
    evidence-deficient attempts to defend the doctrine of limited atonement
    tells me that its defenders are prioritizing their system of thought above
    biblical truth. They are attempting to force the Bible to fit their
    theology, rather than allowing the Bible to shape their theology. They are
    holding fast to tradition that has been handed down to them and thereby
    nullifying the word of God (Mark 7:13). Denying that “all” means “all” or
    that the “whole world” means the “whole world,” or attempting to
    retranslate “especially” as “that is,” or redefining Savior as not meaning
    spiritual Savior are all deceptive tactics that attempt to eviscerate
    Scripture of its clear meaning. And all of this is done to defend the ugly
    doctrine that God only loves some people enough to atone for them and the
rest he predestined to eternal hell before they were even born!    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Prioritizing a system of thought is dangerous precisely for this reason. It
    causes us to create a box to stuff God into, whether He fits in it or not.
    Jim Elliot, the famous missionary who was killed by the Huaorani people of
    Ecuador while trying to share the gospel with them, recognized this threat:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Systematic theology - be careful how you tie down the Word to fit your set
    and final creeds, systems, dogmas, and organized theistic philosophies! The
    Word of God is not bound! It's free to say what it will to the individual,
    and no one can outline it into dispensations which cannot be broken.
    <br/>
	</blockquote>
	<p>We would be wise to heed his words and begin to look at the Bible clearly without the blinders of a failed systematic theology. Let’s allow the Bible to re-write our theology, not our theology to re-write the Bible. </p>
