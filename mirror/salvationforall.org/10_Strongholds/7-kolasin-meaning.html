<h1>
    Kolasin’s Meaning
</h1>
<p>
    One of the important Greek words in the debate on the nature of punishment
is <em>kolasin</em> (κόλασιν). The reason for this is that    <em>kolasin aiōnion</em> is used in
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/25-46.htm">
        Matthew 25:46
    </a>&nbsp;
    regarding the punishment given to the goats for lacking compassion.
    Although we have already seen that <em>kolasin</em> has the sense of
    corrective punishment (and that <em>aiōnion</em> cannot reasonably mean
    everlasting when describing corrective punishment), those who wish to
    defend the traditional doctrine of hell attempt to deny that this is the
    sense of the word. They insist that it is purely retributive punishment
    that does not serve any reforming purpose. Evidence from Greek thinkers,
    however, very strongly demonstrates that corrective punishment is the true
    meaning of <em>kolasin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    We will begin our analysis of <em>kolasin</em> by evaluating the accuracy
    of the claims of the well-known scholar William Barclay, writer of some of
    the most popular Bible study materials of the 20<sup>th</sup> century:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The word for punishment is <em>kolasis</em>. This word was originally a
    gardening word, and its original meaning was <em>pruning trees</em>. In
Greek there are two words for punishment, <em>timoria</em> and <em>kolasis</em>, and there is a quite definite distinction between them.
    Aristotle defines the difference; <em>kolasis</em> is for the sake of the
    one who suffers it; <em>timoria</em> is for the sake of the one who
inflicts it (Rhetoric 1.1 0). Plato says that no one punishes (<em>kolazei</em>) a wrong-doer simply because he has done wrong – that
would be to take unreasonable vengeance (<em>timoreitai</em>). We punish (<em>kolazei</em>) a wrong-doer in order that he may not do wrong again
(Protagoras 323 E). Clement of Alexandria (Stromateis 4.14; 7.16) defines    <em>kolasis</em> as pure discipline, and <em>timoria</em> as the return of
    evil for evil. Aulus Gellius says that <em>kolasis</em> is given that a man
    may be corrected; <em>timoria</em> is given that dignity and authority may
    be vindicated (The Attic Nights 7.14). The difference is quite clear in
    Greek and it is always observed. <em>Timoria</em> is retributive
punishment; <em>kolasis</em> is remedial discipline<strong>. </strong>    <em>Kolasis</em> is always given to amend and to cure.
    (Barclay, <em>The Apostles' Creed</em>, page 189)<strong></strong>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Is Barclay correct in his assessment of the meaning of <em>kolasis</em>? To
    find out, I cross-verified his references to check them for accuracy.
    First, let’s begin by checking the claim that <em>kolasin </em>was used of
    pruning. Although this understanding of the word’s origins is not vital to
    our understanding of <em>kolasin</em> as corrective punishment (it could
    still mean corrective punishment even if it never was used of gardening),
    it is very interesting etymologically. After all, nobody prunes a tree to
    punish it vindictively, but rather to help it to be more fruitful. The idea
    of pruning certainly does fit with the idea of corrective discipline.
</p>
<p>
    Not only that, it’s true.
</p>
<p>
    According to Liddell and Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon, a work of such
    importance to the understanding of ancient Greek that
    <a
        href="https://www.christianbook.com/english-lexicon-revised-supplement-revised-edition/9780198642268/pd/42148?en=google&amp;event=SHOP&amp;kw=academic-100-150%7C42148&amp;p=1179710&amp;dv=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw77TbBRDtARIsAC4l83kBnFOSsibgTwk1BZlRtZ2keuLgYjxRVe1Ut7TRukGnpGwP4nyy29YaApauEALw_wcB"
    >
        ChristianBook.com
    </a>&nbsp;
    claims that it is “used by every student of ancient Greek in the
    English-speaking world,” <em>kolasin</em> does in fact have the meaning of
    pruning, as well as correction. Here is the entry which you can verify for

		When visiting the lexicon, you will need to click on LSJ in the

    For some reason, poor Jones does not get as much credit as Liddell and

    You may have noticed that “checking <em>the</em> growth of trees” is the
    first definition given, followed by a reference: <em>Thphr.CP3.18.2</em>
    (pl.). Unless you are a classics scholar, I imagine this reference is not
very helpful, so I did further research into it. It refers to    <em>On the Causes of Plants (De Causis Plantarum</em>), a botany book about
    plant physiology by Theophrastus (371-286 BC), who is considered to be the
    founding father of botany as well as a scientific colleague and close
    friend of Aristotle
    <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258125435_Aristotle_and_Theophrastus_on_plant-animal_interactions"

        (Thanos 1994).
    </a>&nbsp;
    The numbers are the volume, chapter, and section of this work.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain <em>On the Causes of Plants</em> very
    easily (apparently botany books from the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup>
    century B.C. are not very popular—I can’t imagine why…). Nevertheless,
    Liddell and Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon makes clear reference to checking
    the growth of trees in order to make them more fruitful as an intended
    meaning in Theophrastus’ botany book. Pruning, therefore, is definitely
part of its semantic range (range of meaning) and indicates that <em>kolasin</em> is beneficial to the one experiencing it.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to notice that it is listed as <em>opposed to</em>
    (opp.) <em>timoria, </em>or retributive punishment (vengeance). We will
    examine Aristotle’s reasoning (as referenced by Liddell and Scott) on this
    shortly, but for your reference I have hyperlinked the passage of interest

        The Palgrave Handbook of Infertility in History</a>. In this book, Theophrastus’ logic of pruning almond trees to increase
    fruitfulness is summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>
    “Cultivation, however, was not without risks to the fertility of plants. It
    too could lead to barrenness… Plants grown in rich soil could grow
    excessive leafage and <em>fail to produce fruit</em>. Thus, according to
    Theophrastus, almond trees planted in too rich a soil ‘grow over-luxuriant
(exhubrisasai) on account of the rich feeding, and <em>fail to bear fruit</em>’… The    <em>solution was to prune such plants</em>.” (Davis and Loughran 2017)

<h4>
    <em>Kolasin</em>
    as Defined by Greek Thinkers
</h4>
<p>
    Much more important, however, than the visual picture of <em>kolasin</em>
    as pruning to increase fruitfulness is the fact that prominent
    Greek-speaking thinkers <em>explicitly</em> define it as corrective
    punishment. Barclay makes reference to these thinkers in his quote above,
    but we will now examine them in primary sources in a roughly chronological
    fashion. You will see that the case for <em>kolasin</em> as corrective
    punishment is virtually unassailable. Let’s take a look, beginning with
    Plato (c.428-347 B.C.).

<blockquote>
    For if you will consider <strong>punishment</strong> Socrates, and what
    control it has over wrong-doers, the facts will inform you that men agree
    in regarding virtue as procured. No one <strong>punishes</strong> a
    wrong-doer from the mere contemplation or on account of his wrong-doing,
    unless one takes unreasoning vengeance (<a

must have in mind that virtue comes by training: for you observe that he <strong>punishes</strong> to deter.
</blockquote>
<p>
All of the above references to the word “punish” (which I have made<strong> bold</strong> for easy reference) are conjugations of the verb    <em>kolazo</em> (κολάζω). Here are the forms that <em>kolazo</em> takes in
    this part of <em>Protagoras</em>:

    </a>&nbsp;here for even easier reference: “<em>check”, “chastise”, “to be corrected”, “chastened”, “punish”. </em> It
    also once again mentions its agricultural use in the sense of checking the
growth of plants (pruning) citing Theophrastus’ other major work    <em>Enquiry Into Plants</em> (<em>Historia Plantarum</em>), as well as
    another part of <em>On the Causes of Plants</em>, yet further confirmation
    that it does have this sense as a “gardening word” as Barclay claims.
</p>
<p>
    You should also notice that Plato specifically contrasts <em>kolazo </em>(a
    verb form of <em>kolasin</em>) with taking vengeance (<a
        href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=timwrei%3Dtai&amp;la=greek&amp;can=timwrei%3Dtai0&amp;prior=a)logi/stws"
        target="morph"
    >τιμωρεῖται</a>/<em>timoreitai</em>—a verb form of <em>timoria</em>, which we will see
    again later). Plato is exceptionally clear that <em>kolazo </em>is
    corrective punishment that is done in order to benefit the person who
    committed wrong-doing as well as those who see the punishment and learn
    from it. He contrasts this with <em>timoreitai</em>, the taking of
    retributive vengeance. This is significant because Plato specifically tells
    us that <em>kolasin</em> means corrective punishment that serves a didactic
    purpose and is aimed at reform, as opposed to simply getting back at
    someone. For Plato <em>kolasin </em>is the type of punishment practiced by
    rational people because it produces beneficial results (or fruit, if you
    would like to continue the pruning analogy).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Timoria</em>, or vengeance, on the other hand, is something only done by wild beasts
    without sense. It must therefore be asked which term is more fitting in
    describing punishment from God—the rational form of corrective disciplinary
    punishment or the form of punishment reserved for irrational wild animals?
    Perhaps Matthew chose <em>kolasin </em>for a reason.
</p>
<p>
By the way, the fact that the verb forms of <em>kolasin</em> and    <em>timoria</em> are used in <em>Protagoras</em> should raise no objection.
    The words still have the same sense, in the same way that the word
    “punishment” and the word “punish” have the same sense, with “punishment”
being the noun (like <em>kolasin</em>) and “punish” being the verb (like    <em>kolazo</em>). In other words, <em>kolasin </em>is the noun form of the
    verb <em>kolazo</em>,<em> </em>just as punishment is the noun form of the
    verb punish.

    Next, we will examine the words of another of ancient Greece’s preeminent
    philosophical thinkers, Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC). You should notice that
    he has the same understanding as Plato, although he does not go so far as
    to reserve <em>timoria</em> as only pertaining to beasts.

		But there is a difference between revenge (<a

    sufferer, the former in the interest of him who inflicts it, that he may
    obtain satisfaction.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, we see a clear distinction between <em>kolasis</em> (corrective
punishment) and <em>timoria </em>(retributive punishment or vengeance).    <em>Kolasis</em> is inflicted “in the interest of the sufferer” so that he
    will mend his ways. It is again specifically defined as beneficial to the
    one being punished.
</p>
	<div class="box">
		By the way, you can verify that Aristotle is using    <em>kolasis</em> and <em>timoria </em>respectively
    <a
        href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10%3Asection%3D17"
    >
        here
    </a>&nbsp;in the same way as described above for Plato’s writings. I also think it
might be helpful as a reminder to mention that <em>kolasin</em> and    <em>kolasis</em> have the same meaning and are simply different inflections
    of the same word. If this seems strange, it must be remembered that English
    words are inflected in a similar manner without changing meaning. As a
    simple example, the word “dogs” is a plural inflection of the word “dog”
but they both refer to furry canines that bark. For the curious,<em> kolasin</em> is the accusative feminine singular form of    <em>kolasis</em>. In summary, the meaning is the same.
	</div>
<p>
Although Barclay does not mention it, another important reference to    <em>kolasis </em>is made in the Septuagint version of Ezekiel. As a
    reminder, the Septuagint is the earliest extant translation of the Hebrew
Scriptures into Greek by Jewish scholars. It was composed during the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> centuries BC (nearer than Plato and
    Aristotle to the time of Jesus’ earthly life) and represents the
    understanding of Jewish scholars familiar with both Greek and Hebrew. For
    these reasons, its testimony is very valuable. With this in mind, consider
    the following:
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 43:10-11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel,    <strong>that they may cease from their sins</strong>; and shew its aspect
and the arrangement of it. And they shall bear their    <strong>punishment (kolasis)</strong> for all the things that they have
    done: and thou shalt describe the house, and its entrances, and the plan
    thereof, and all its ordinances, and thou shalt make known to them all the
    regulations of it, and describe them before them:
    <strong>
        and they shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do
        them</strong>.<em> </em>(Brenton Septuagint Translation—available here:
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/sep/ezekiel/43.htm">
        https://biblehub.com/sep/ezekiel/43.htm</a>)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It seems quite clear from the passage above that the purpose of the
    punishment (<em>kolasis</em>) that the house of Israel experienced was
    corrective. It was meant to result in change, so that they “may cease from
    their sins” and so that “they shall keep all my commandments, and all my
    ordinances, and do them.” It would be very difficult contextually to argue
    that retributive vengeance was in mind. Once again, <em>kolasin</em>
    clearly has the sense of corrective chastisement, not mere punishment for
    its own sake.
</p>
<h4>
    AD Evidence
</h4>
<p>
    So far, we have only been looking at examples from before Christ. For this
    reason, the objection might be raised that <em>kolasin </em>had changed in
    its meaning by the time of Jesus and the writing of the Gospel of Matthew.
    However, this is not the case. Again, we have clear, unambiguous evidence
    that <em>kolasin </em>is corrective in nature.
</p>
<p>
    Aulus Gellius (c. 125 – c. 180 AD) was a Roman author and grammarian who
    was educated in Athens. While in Athens (located on the Attic Peninsula),
    he wrote his most well-known work, the <em>Attic Nights</em> which was a
    “compilation of notes on grammar, philosophy, history, antiquarianism, and
    other subjects” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Gellius">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Gellius</a>). Because this work was written shortly after the writing of the New
Testament, its testimony is very useful in determining how the word <em>kolasin</em> was understood at the time. Gellius, in fact, gives an
    undeniably clear definition:
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/7*.html">
        Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights, Book VII, Chapter 14, p.129
    </a>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		It has been thought that there should be three reasons for punishing
crimes. One of these, which the Greeks call either    <strong>κόλασις (<em>kolasis</em>)</strong> or νουθεσία,
    <strong>
        is the infliction of punishment for the purpose of correction and
        reformation, in order that one who has done wrong thoughtlessly may
        become more careful and scrupulous.
    </strong>
    The second is called τιμωρία by those who have made a more exact
    differentiation between terms of this kind. That reason for punishment
    exists when the dignity and the prestige of the one who is sinned against
    must be maintained, lest the omission of punishment bring him into contempt
    and diminish the esteem in which he is held; and therefore they think that
    it was given a name derived from the preservation of honour (τιμή). A third
    reason for punishment is that which is called by the Greeks παράδειγμα,
    when punishment is necessary for the sake of example, in order that others
    through fear of a recognized penalty may be kept from similar sins, which
    it is to the common interest to prevent. Therefore our forefathers also
    used the word exempla, or "examples," for the severest and heaviest
    penalties. Accordingly, when there is either strong hope that the culprit
    will voluntarily correct himself without punishment, or on the other hand
    when there is no hope that he could be reformed and corrected; or when
    there is no need to fear loss of prestige in the one who has been sinned
    against; or if the sin is not of such a sort that punishment must be
    inflicted in order that it may inspire a necessary feeling of fear — then
    in the case of all such sins the desire to inflict punishment does not seem
    to be at all fitting.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    As a Roman educated in Greece (and therefore very competent in Greek),
    Gellius was explaining the meaning and purpose of Greek words for
    punishment to his fellow Romans. He makes it clear that <em>kolasis</em> is
    the type of punishment that is done “for the purpose of correction and
    reformation,” thus plainly distinguishing <em>kolasin</em> from other terms
    for punishment, including <em>timoria</em>, which he describes as being
    done to preserve the honor of the offended party. It should be noted
    that this view of <em>timoria</em> is more purposeful than mere vengeance
    and could serve a positive purpose of restoring honor to the offended
    individual. The third reason for punishment is to deter others from
    committing the same sins, for which he uses the term <em>paradeigma</em>.
    This, however, is also a reason given by Plato for <em>kolasin</em>, as we
    saw above. So, in short, punishment of any type must serve some positive
    purpose or “the desire to inflict punishment does not seem to be at all
    fitting,” but <em>kolasin</em> is used specifically to refer to punishment
    that is beneficial and transformative to the sinner.
</p>
<p>
    Another important point regarding Aulus Gellius’ reasons for punishment is
    that he notes that not all people observe the distinction between these
    terms. He hints at this reality when he mentions “those who have made a
    more exact differentiation between terms of this kind.” This implies that
    some do not make a differentiation between the Greek words for punishment.
    Instead, these individuals are seemingly unaware of the nuances that
    distinguish these words and use them interchangeably. This is significant
    because it explains why there are some examples from ancient literature in
    which <em>kolasin</em> appears to be retributive rather than corrective.
    These examples, however, seem to represent inappropriate and uninformed
    uses of the word that lack precision and that would be inherently
    misleading to a person with a better command of the language.
</p>
<p>
My contention is that the Gospel writer was neither ignorant of<em> kolasin’s </em>meaning, nor imprecise in his diction. He did    <em>not </em>misuse <em>kolasin</em>, but instead specifically chose it for
    a purpose: namely, to clearly indicate corrective punishment to
    Greek-speakers of the time.
</p>
<p>
    The understanding of <em>kolasin</em> as corrective punishment is not only
    evident in secular thinkers, but also in Greek-speaking Christians.
    Consider the words of Clement of Alexandria (150 A.D. to about 215 A.D.),
    head one of the most significant centers of Christian thought of the early
    church, the catechetical school of Alexandria.
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0210.htm">
        Clement of Alexandria, <em>The Stromata (aka </em><em>Miscellanies</em>
        ), Book VII, Chapter 16
    </a>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For there are partial corrections, which are called chastisements (<em>kolasin</em>)<em>,</em> which many of us who have been in transgression
    incur, by falling away from the Lord's people. But as children are
    chastised (<em>kolazo</em>) by their teacher, or their father, so are we by
Providence. But God does not punish (<em>timoreitai</em>), for punishment (<em>timoria</em>) is retaliation for evil. He chastises (<em>kolazo</em>),
    however, for good to those who are chastised (<em>kolazo</em>),
    collectively and individually.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This passage makes it clear that Clement views the chastisements of God as
    corrective rather than vindictive or vengeful. Like all the Greek thinkers
    discussed so far, Clement views <em>kolasin </em>as beneficial to those who
    experience it. And he was certainly not alone in this understanding of his
    native tongue.

	<h4>Epiphanius and Methodius <em>The Panarion</em>:
</h4>
<p>
Some evidence comes from unexpected sources. Books II and III of the    <em> Panarion </em>by Ephiphanius were written to oppose various Christian
    “heresies” and were written sometime between 374 and 377 AD
    <a
        href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Epiphanius-of-Constantia#ref4358"
    >
        (Encyclopedia Brittanica).
    </a>
    Epiphanius himself was perhaps Origen’s most bitter critic, making it an
    “obsession” of nearly thirty years to ruin “Origen and Origenism in
    Catholic opinion”
    <a
        href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ExrZDKtgM34C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=epiphanius+%22obsession%22+origen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=THxTxSxcLt&amp;sig=i68XJSDEC5OH1DRGP4pBwxdcWsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQjqu4i73dAhVrqlQKHREnCrEQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=obsession&amp;f=false"
    >
        (<em>Fathers of the Church, Saint Jerome: dogmatic and polemical works
        </em>
        <em>, page 49</em>)</a>. Interestingly, Epiphanius does not attack universal restoration as a
    heresy in his writing against Origen in the <em>Panarion</em> (I know this
    because I read the whole attack). His contention instead is about the
    nature of our bodies at the resurrection. As part of his argument, he
    extensively quotes another church father named Methodius, whom he considers
    an authority, in his dialogue with a supposed Origenist named Aglaophon.
    Consider his words:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Then those who are judged (κρινόμενοι) are benefited. Their wickedness is
    removed because it is prevented by their torments (βασάνοις), just as
    illnesses are removed by surgery and pharmacy at the doctor’s. For the
    punishment (δίκην) of the criminal is the correction of the soul, which
    throws off the severe disease of wickedness.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		He agreed.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“Oh? Wouldn’t you say that the punishments (κολάσεις) which are
    proportionate to their crimes are imposed with justice on criminals, just
    as surgery proportionate to their hurts is applied to patients?”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		He nodded.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“Then one whose crimes deserve death is punished (δίκην) with death, one
	    whose crimes deserve the lash is punished (δίκην) with the lash, and one whose crimes merit imprisonment is punished (δίκην) with prison?”
</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Aglaophon agreed.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“And the offender incurs the penalty of prison, blows, or some other
    punishment (τιμωρίᾳ) of the sort, so that he will reform and abandon his
    wickedness, like bent wood straightened by hard blows?”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“You’re quite right,” he said.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“The judge isn’t punishing (Τιμωρεῖται) him for his past crime but for the
    future, so that he won’t do it again?”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“Plainly,” he said.&nbsp;<a

<div class="box">
	The koine Greek of the <em>Panarion</em> is available    <a href="http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/panariog.htm">here.</a> I have
    also copied the Greek text for the section quoted above for your
    convenience and included it in the notes and citations at the end of this
    chapter, so that you can verify the accuracy of the Greek. Tip: if you want
    to see it in the source, the easiest way to do so would be to copy a small
    section of the text included in the notes and search for it in the webpage.
</div>
<p>
    It must be noted that Methodius is <em>taking for granted </em>that
    punishment is corrective. It is an assumed foundational premise that is
    considered obvious by all parties. This is something that he, Ephiphanius,
    Aglaophon, and Origen agreed on wholeheartedly. It is, in fact, the crux of
    Methodius’ argument against Origen’s view of the resurrection and is much
    further expounded so that we see that even “death was devised for the sake
    of conversion” (p. 169).
</p>
<p>
    With this in mind, let’s now analyze the language to see how this relates
    to the Greek terms for punishment. Although <em>kolasin</em> has so far
    been the focus of this chapter, it is noteworthy that Methodius and
    Epiphanius use not only <em>kolasin</em> as corrective, healing punishment
    but also nearly every other biblical term for punishment. Remember, the
    entire force of Methodius’ argument is based on this fundamental
    supposition. With this in mind, let’s now examine each of the Greek terms
    used in the above passage and how they all, in the minds of these church
    fathers, indicated reformatory punishment:
</p>
<p>
    1. <em>Kolaseis</em> (κολάσεις) is a plural form of <em>kolasin </em>(for
    which reason it is translated as punishments). Notice that it is analogous
    to the application of surgery to patients. It is both proportional to the
    crime committed and healing.
</p>
<p>
    2. <em>Krinomenoi </em>(κρινόμενοι) is a form of the word <em>krino</em>,
    which means “to judge.” This word is used quite frequently of judgment in
    the Bible. Notice that “those who are judged are benefited” because “their
    wickedness is removed.” It is clear that this understanding of judgment
    comes from the Bible. Consider, for example 1 Corinthians 11:32 which
    states that “when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined” for our
    benefit.
</p>
<p>
    3. <em>Basanois</em> (βασάνοις) is a plural form of <em>basanos</em>, often
    translated as torment in English Bibles. <em>Basanois </em>is the exact
    word used to describe the torments experienced by the rich man in Hades
    (the realm of the dead) in Luke 16:23. It is critical to note that such
    torments were considered medicinal. As Methodius (and Epiphanius) claim so
    clearly, “wickedness is removed because it is prevented by their torments
    (βασάνοις), just as illnesses are removed by surgery and pharmacy at the
    doctor’s.”
</p>
<p>
    4. <em>Diken </em>(δίκην) is another term for punishment or justice used in
    the Bible. It is, in fact, used in two of the favorite verses of those who
    attempt to promote the traditional doctrine endless torment: 2
    Thessalonians 1:9 and Jude 1:7. I have already discussed these verses in
    some detail
    <a
        href="https://www.salvationforall.org/3_Is_Hell_Biblical/4.1%20more_eternal_passages.html"
    >
        here
    </a>
    and
    <a
        href="../8_Addressing_Objections/12_destruction.html"
    >
        here,
    </a>
    demonstrating that they <em>do not</em> in fact provide good support for
    endless hell, so I will forego repeating this analysis again. The critical
    thing to notice here is that <em>diken </em>is corrective punishment.
Notice that “the punishment (δίκην) of the criminal    <em>is the correction of the soul</em>, which throws off the severe disease
    of wickedness” and that it is proportional to the offense committed (which
    cannot actually be true of a never-ending punishment). Therefore, by the
    estimation of these Greek-speaking church fathers, the punishments of 2
    Thessalonians 1:9 and Jude 1:7 were designed to correct the souls of those
    punished. Such purpose for punishment or judgment is very well-supported
    scripturally, as we have already seen.
</p>
<p>
    5. <em>Timoria</em> (τιμωρίᾳ) is the form of punishment that several of our
    Greek thinkers have contrasted with <em>kolasin</em> as vengeance for the
    purpose of satisfying the punisher. <em>Timoreitai</em> (Τιμωρεtῖται) is a
    verb form of this word. But, as Aulus Gellius claimed, not everyone
    distinguished between these terms for punishment. It seems that we see an
    example of this in the <em>Panarion</em>. It must be noted, however, that
    Methodius and Epiphanius view even <em>timoria</em> as corrective
punishment, not purposeless vengeance. They claim, in essence, that    <em>all forms of punishment</em> in the hands of God are for the purpose of
    correction and training in righteousness. The punishment (τιμωρίᾳ) of the
    sinner is meted out “so that he will reform and abandon his wickedness,
    like bent wood straightened by hard blows” and not “for his past crime but
    for the future, so that he won’t do it again.” The correction of the soul
and destruction of evil tendencies is clearly in view, even for    <em>timoria</em>, not just for <em>kolasin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, this passage from the <em>Panarion</em> shows quite clearly
    that Epiphanius and Methodius viewed <em>kolasin</em> and every other form
    of punishment as therapeutic and corrective when applied by a righteous
    God. It is also worth noting that they, like the rest of the sources
    discussed thus far, fluently spoke and wrote koine Greek, the language in
    which the <em>Panarion</em> was originally composed. This further
    illustrates that the concept of restorative punishment was not isolated to
    Origen and his followers, but rather completely independent of him. Even
    his harshest critics viewed punishment in this way, demonstrating just how
    widespread this understanding was in the early church.
</p>
<h4>
    Summary of Evidence
</h4>
<p>
    Thus far we have seen that numerous fluent writers of Greek have explicitly
    defined <em>kolasin</em> as corrective punishment and used it in such a way
    that demonstrates this to be its clear meaning. These sources include
    secular writers such as Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Aulus Gellius,
    as well as Christian sources like Clement of Alexandria, Methodius and
    Epiphanius, spanning a roughly 800-year period from Plato (born in 428
    B.C.) to Epiphanius (died in 403 A.D.). It is also noteworthy that these
    writings occurred both before Christ and after Christ, and that some of
    them were written near to the time of the composition of the Gospels.
</p>
<h3>
    Timeline of <em>Kolasin </em>Definitions and Usage
</h3>

	<img alt="Timeline for Kolasin Thinkers" src="../images/timeline%20kolasin%20thinkers.png" style="height: 219px" width="626"><p>
    I have little doubt that more examples could be obtained, but for now this
    seems more than sufficient to show quite clearly the legitimacy of the
    claim that <em>kolasin</em> refers to corrective punishment.
</p>
<h4>
    The Opposition
</h4>
<p>
In spite of all of this irrefutable evidence, traditionalists<em> still</em> try to cast doubt on the meaning of the word    <em>kolasin</em>. The motivation for this is clear: if the punishment in
    mind is corrective, then it is <em>nonsensical</em> to insist that it goes
    on forever. It is therefore an absolute necessity to deny corrective
    punishment as <em>kolasin’s</em> meaning if one is to continue to adhere to
    a doctrine of eternal torment in hell. For this reason, attempts are made
    to introduce doubts that this is its meaning. Here is an example of one
    such attempt, as found in the book <em>Erasing Hell</em> by Francis Chan
    and Preston Sprinkle:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The argument goes like this: The purpose of “correction” or “pruning,” of
    course, is to improve something, to bring out its fullest potential. Or in
    this context, to correct the wicked of their bad behavior until they are no
    longer wicked. So according to this argument, Jesus is not talking about an
    everlasting punishment for the wicked here, but rather a time of correction
    so that those enduring punishment will ultimately be saved. During this
    time, there may be “endless opportunities in an endless amount of time for
    people to say yes to God.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Part of me wants to believe that this is true. This argument appears to
    reconcile God’s love with Jesus’ harsh words about hell. But is this what
    the words <em>aionios kolasis</em> actually mean? Is this what Jesus is
    speaking of in Matthew 25:46?
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		I don’t think so, and here’s why. Let’s first deal with the word<em> kolasis</em>. Does it refer to <em>correction</em> or<em> punishment?</em> For three reasons, the word means “punishment.” (<em>Erasing Hell</em>, Chapter 3)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    We will shortly evaluate whether the claims made above are valid, but
    before we do, it is important to discuss a misconception of the author that
    is very important: he assumes that correction and punishment are mutually
    exclusive concepts. This is a very significant misunderstanding. Painful
    punishment is very often described as corrective in the Bible. See, for
    example, Hebrews 12:4-11 and practically all of the Old Testament judgment
    passages in which God severely punished nations and individuals so that
they will know that He is the Lord (see    <em>Section 4: Biblical Judgment: a Consistent Theme of Redemption</em>,
    especially
    <a
        href="../5_Biblical_Judgment/3_purpose_of_judgment_part1.html"
    >
        here
    </a>
    and
    <a
        href="../5_Biblical_Judgment/4_purpose_of_judgment_nations.html"
    >
        here
    </a>
    ).
</p>
<p>
    A further interesting note regarding Hebrews 12:4-11 is that it
    specifically references the Septuagint version of Proverbs 3:11-12. As a
    reminder, the Septuagint is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament
    that was commonly read in Biblical times. Here is the reference:
</p>
<h3>
    Hebrews 12:5-6 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		“My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;
	</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    For whom the Lord loves He chastens,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    And scourges every son whom He receives.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, you may think that the word “scourges” sounds a bit harsh, but it is
    actually a very good translation of the Greek word <em>mastigoi </em>
    (μαστιγοῖ) used in the verse. <em>Mastigoi </em>literally means to whip or
    scourge. That is <em>certainly</em> a term that denotes painful punishment,
but the context is undeniably clear that the punishment is    <em>corrective</em> and is done <em>because of God’s Fatherly love</em>.
</p>
<div class="box">You can see this biblical reference to scourging as corrective
punishment in Greek and English    <a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/hebrews/12-6.htm">here</a>.
</div>
<p>
The false dichotomy between correction and punishment that is presented in    <em>Erasing Hell</em> is clearly unjustified. Punishment is very frequently
    corrective in Scripture as well as human experience. Nevertheless, when
    Chan and Sprinkle use the term punishment, they insist that it is not
    corrective, but purely retributive. Although not biblically supported, it
    is important to understand that this is what they mean when they say
    “punishment.” It is also key to recognize this misunderstanding as the
    basis for their incorrect claim that Universalists deny punishment for the
    wicked. This is certainly not the case. Punishment is not denied, but it is
    purposeful, corrective, and befitting the God who is the “Savior of all
    people” (1 Timothy 4:10), rather than purposeless, hateful, and vindictive.
</p>
<p>
    This being said, let’s now analyze <em>Erasing Hell’s</em> first “reason”
    for why punishment must be retributive, not correctional:
</p>
<h3>
    Erasing Hell, Chapter 3
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “First, the word <em>kolasis</em> is only used three other times in the New
    Testament, and in all three passages it clearly means punishment. It is
    also used in Jewish literature around the time of the New Testament in the
    same way.
    <sup>
        <a href="https://calibre-internal.invalid/index.html#filepos167543">
            11
        </a>
    </sup>
    Jesus’ Jewish audience would have heard Jesus say “punishment” not
    “correction” when He said the word <em>kolasis</em>.
    <sup>
        <a href="https://calibre-internal.invalid/index.html#filepos169551">
            12
        </a>
    </sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
    I left the endnote references above in place on purpose. The reason is that
    Chan and Sprinkle never list the New Testament <em>kolasis</em> verses in
    the body of the book but rather only in the endnotes. They never explain
    why these verses “clearly” mean retributive punishment. The reason I think
    this is significant is that I doubt that most readers actually investigate
    the endnotes. Do you regularly interrupt the flow of your reading to flip
    to the end of the chapter to study the endnotes? I imagine most people do
    not and instead take these pastors on their word. They said it, so it must
    be true. The author even said that part of him “wants to believe” that the
    punishment of Matthew 25:46 could be correction. Given this supposed
    desire, why would he misrepresent the Bible?
</p>
<p>
    Well, as it turns out, I did look at the endnotes to check the legitimacy
    of this claim. The authors claim the following New Testament verses as
    evidence that retributive punishment, not corrective punishment is the
    “clear” meaning of <em>kolasis</em>: Acts 4:21, 1 John 4:18, 2 Peter 2:9.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s begin with Acts 4:21. You will see that, contrary to Chan and
Sprinkle’s claim, it <em>clearly</em> <em>does</em> mean    <em>corrective</em> punishment, <em>not</em> retribution.
</p>
<h3>
    Acts 4:21
</h3>
<blockquote>
    So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way
    of punishing (<em>kolasōntai</em>) them, because of the people, since they
    all glorified God for what had been done.<em> </em>
</blockquote>
<div class="box">
    
    <em>Kolasōntai </em>
is just a conjugation of the verb <em>kolazó</em>, (the verb form of    <em>kolasin</em>).
</div>
<p>
    A little context: Peter and John had just healed a man that had been
    crippled for over forty years. Following this miracle, they preached the
    gospel and many people believed them. The religious leaders had them
    arrested in order to prevent them from preaching the good news. The context
    of the passage makes it very clear that the religious leaders sought to
    punish them in order to change their behavior, not to satisfy a thirst for
    retribution. In fact, their motivation is explicitly stated. Let’s take a
    look by examining more of the context:
</p>
<h3>
    Acts 4:13-22
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they
    were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that
    they had been with Jesus. And seeing the man who had been healed standing
    with them, they could say nothing against it. But when they had commanded
    them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
    saying, “What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle
    has been done through them <em>is</em> evident to all who dwell in
Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <em>it.</em>    <strong>But so that it spreads no further among the people</strong>, let us
    severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this
    name.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the
    name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is
    right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For
    we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” So when they
had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of    <strong>punishing</strong> them, because of the people, since they all
    glorified God for what had been done. For the man was over forty years old
    on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, here’s the question: Why did the religious leaders want to punish Peter
    and John?
</p>
<p>
    We do not have to guess. The passage tells us plainly that the motivation
    of these leaders was to prevent Peter and John from preaching the good news
    “so that it spreads no further among the people.” It was correctional. They
    wanted to punish Peter and John to alter their behavior, to make them stop
    doing what they were doing, to cause them to reform. In the minds of these
    religious leaders, Peter and John were wrong and needed to be fixed. Their
    goal in punishment was clearly to correct what they perceived to be wrong
    action.
</p>
<p>
    It clearly was <em>not</em> to slake their thirst for retributive
    vengeance. The context simply does not allow this interpretation. The
    Pharisees and Sadducees were not sitting around thinking how good it would
feel to get back at Peter and John for their preaching; they wanted them to    <em>stop preaching</em>! Yet <em>Erasing Hell</em> claims that retributive
    punishment <em>must </em>be the meaning of <em>kolasin</em> based on Acts
    4:21. Ironically, Acts 4:21 clearly leads to the opposite conclusion! In
    context, <em>kolasin</em> <em>must mean corrective punishment</em>. The
    passage tells us so!
</p>
<p>
    An alleged proof text that <em>proves the opposite</em> of the authors’
    emphatic claims should make us pause, especially when the reference to the
    “proof text” is hidden in the endnotes (which most people ignore).
</p>
<p>
    The other two biblical passages cited in <em>Erasing Hell</em> do no better
    in making their case.
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 4:18
</h3>
<blockquote>
    There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear
    has to do with punishment (<em>kolasin</em>). The one who fears is not made
    perfect in love.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This verse proves <em>nothing</em> about the nature of punishment. It is
    simply saying that perfect love drives out the fear of punishment and that
    those who fear are not yet made perfect in love. Curiously, the traditional
    doctrine of hell <em>promotes</em> fear, the <em>exact opposite</em> of the
    result of perfect love, which drives fear out.
</p>
<p>
    At any rate, this verse is ambiguous about the nature of the punishment.
    There is no reason why the punishment cannot be corrective. Isn’t
    corrective punishment also something to be feared? Don’t we call our
    penitentiaries <em>correctional</em> facilities? The aim of prisons is to
    correct and reform criminals (not to say that this goal is always
    attained). Is there not a fear of being thrown in prison for a crime, even
    though the time spent there is intended to help the criminal reform?
</p>
<p>
    On a more personal note, did you ever do anything as a child for which you
    deserved disciplinary punishment? Even if your parents were not abusive and
    were disciplining you for your good, did you not have any fear of the
    punishment you would receive? The imagery of being scourged by God in
    disciplinary, corrective punishment as seen in Hebrews 12 certainly
    warrants some feeling of fear. But as we are made perfect in love (and who
    has arrived at that state?), this fear will vanish, as we will understand
    fully that God is love and His every action is for our ultimate benefit.
    Children usually fear getting shots, but as an adult I no longer fear them
    because I believe that they can produce beneficial results. In the same
    way, a growth in maturity allows us to understand God’s perfect love
    better, driving out the debilitating fear that used to control us.
</p>
<p>
    This verse provides no support for the claim that punishment is
    retributive. Instead, we see that perfect love drives out our fear of
    punishment because we know that all punishment by God is done in perfect
    love for our benefit. Also, once we are perfected in love, we will no
    longer fear punishment at all because one who is made <em>perfect</em> does
    not require any corrective punishment (hence the term “perfect”).
</p>
<p>
    Also, quite ironically, a peek at the immediate context of this verse
    reveals that a hallmark of true faith is to see and testify that Jesus is
    “the Savior of the world.” It is one line of evidence that allows us to
    “know that we live in him and he in us.”
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 4:13-18
</h3>
<blockquote>
    This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of
    his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son
    to be <strong>the Savior of the world</strong>. If anyone acknowledges that
    Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. And so we know
    and rely on the love God has for us.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. This is
    how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the
    day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. There is no fear in love.
    But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment.
    The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This passage tells us that Jesus is the Savior of the world, not just of
    some. By definition, a Savior must save the object He came to save. Our
    understanding that Christ is the Savior of the world allows us to fully
    rely on God’s love, to understand that He is love, to emulate His love in
    the world, and to have no fear because our understanding of this perfect
    love drives out fear. I can testify myself to the truth of John’s claim
    here.
</p>
<p>
    Does the God of eternal conscious torment produce the same fearlessness in
    you? If not, perhaps it is because this view of God is distorted,
    disallowing the cathartic belief that Jesus is indeed, and truly the Savior
    of the world.
</p>
<p>
    The final verse referenced in <em>Erasing Hell</em> is 2 Peter 2:9.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Peter 2:9 (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the
    unrighteous under punishment (kolazomenous/κολαζομένους) until the day of
    judgment,
</blockquote>
<p>
    This verse simply does not tell us anything about the nature of the
    punishment that the wicked are experiencing. There is certainly no reason
    why it cannot be corrective. In fact, we have strong evidence based on the
    contextual references to Noah’s flood and Sodom and Gomorrah that they are
    corrective. This may sound surprising to you if you have not read all of
    this website, but both of those judgments ultimately result in redemption,
    according to the Bible:
</p>
<h3>
    1 Peter 3:18-20 and 4:6:

<p>
    So, in both of these examples, we see judgment and death followed by
    restoration and life. By interpreting death as a final retributive
punishment, theologians and pastors seem to forget that the Lord kills and    <em>then</em> He makes alive, in that order (Deuteronomy 32:39, 1 Samuel
    2:6). Death is not the end. Instead “there will be a resurrection of both
    the righteous and the wicked” (Acts 24:15) for “Christ died and returned to
    life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living” (Romans
    14:9). Wickedness is put to an end, not perpetuated eternally in a
    different location. But this destruction of wickedness is restorative and
    enables those who experience it to “live in the spirit the way God does.”

    Erasing Hell and the Book of Wisdom
</h4>
<p>
    Chan and/or Sprinkle also cite “Jewish literature around the time of the
    New Testament” as evidence that <em>kolasis</em> is not corrective. Again,
    we must turn to the endnotes for clarification: “For its use in Jewish
    literature, see especially Wis. 16:1–2, where the verb <em>kolazo</em> is
    used synonymously with the verb <em>basanizo,</em> which means torment.
Retributive punishment is clearly in view” (<em>Erasing Hell</em>,    <em> </em>Chapter<em> </em>3 Endnotes).
</p>
<p>
The book being referenced here is <em>Wisdom</em>, also known as the    <em>Wisdom of Solomon</em>, a second century B.C. book that is absent from
    Protestant Bibles but included in the Deuterocanonical books (also known as
    the Apocrypha) of Catholic Bibles. It is also recommended reading in the
    Eastern Orthodox church (though it does not appear to have canonical
    status).

</div>
<p>
    Let’s now examine this reference to see if it is true that “retributive
    punishment is clearly in view.”

<p>
    Contextually, it is critical to note that this is a reference to the
    plagues of the book of Exodus against Egypt. Claiming that these plagues
    were “clearly” retributive punishment ignores the stated purposes of the
    plagues which were:
</p>
<p>
    1. To free the Israelites from slavery and oppression by convincing the
    Egyptians to release them.
</p>
<p>
    2. To convince the Egyptians that the LORD is the true God of all.
</p>
<p>
    Both of these purposes, once again, are corrective. They both are meant to
    inspire a change in behavior and a change of heart. In fact, prior to the
    beginning of the plagues, God says the following to Moses in Exodus 7:4-5:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring
    my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by
    great acts of judgment. <strong>The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord</strong>, when I
    stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring out the people of Israel from
    among them.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    This concept that the plagues will teach people (especially Pharaoh and the
    Egyptians) that he is the LORD and the only true God is repeated many times
    (Exodus 7:17, Exodus 8:10, Exodus 8:22, Exodus 9:14, Exodus 9:16, Exodus
    9:29, and Exodus 10:2). <em>Learning</em> is clearly the motivation for the
    punishments of the plagues, <em>not </em>retributive vengeance. The goal is
    to make God known not only to the Israelites, but also to those who set
    themselves up as His enemies.
</p>
<p>
    Although the plagues do not seem to fully convince Pharaoh and the
    Egyptians of God’s supremacy, we do see hints of the inception of
    transformation. After the plague of the gnats, even Pharaoh’s magicians
    exclaim that this work is the “finger of God” (Exodus 8:19). And Pharaoh
    himself acknowledges his sin in Exodus 9:27: “This time I have sinned; the
    Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.” Pharaoh
    appears to be getting closer to humility, though we do not quite see him
    become truly humble in the Exodus itself. In fact, following this
    confession of sin, Moses calls his bluff, saying “But as for you and your
    servants, I know that you do not <em>yet</em> fear the Lord God” (Exodus
    9:30). In this very statement, however, we see two important things:
</p>
<p>
    1. The intent of the plagues is to bring Pharaoh and the Egyptians
    closer to having reverence for God.
</p>
<p>
    2. They have not arrived at this state of reverence <em>yet</em>. By its
    very nature, however, the phrase “not yet” strongly implies that eventually
    they will reach this goal. They just have <em>not yet</em>.
</p>
<p>
All of this points to the fact that the book of Wisdom uses    <em>kolazo </em>and <em>basanizo</em> (torment) in the same way as
    Methodius and Epiphanius. They are medicinal, educational, and preventative
    of further wickedness.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, by investigating the allusion to the Exodus made in Wisdom 16:1-2, we
    see the Chan and Sprinkle’s claim that “retributive punishment is clearly
    in view” is <em>clearly</em> incorrect. We do not, however, even need to
    examine this allusion to see this fact. Just three verses later in the book
    of Wisdom itself, we see an example of another punishment and its purpose.
    Once again it is clearly <em>corrective</em> (not vengeful) punishment that
    is in view.

<blockquote>
    For when the dire venom of beasts came upon them
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    and they were dying from the bite of crooked serpents,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>your anger endured not to the end</strong>.

<blockquote>
    But as a warning, for a short time they were <strong>terrorized</strong>,
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    though they had a
    <strong>
        sign of salvation, to remind them of the precept of your law</strong>.

<blockquote>
    For the one who turned toward it was saved,

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>By this also you convinced our foes</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong> that you are the one who delivers from all evil.</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, even the immediate context of Wisdom 16 makes the clear case that God’s
    anger is temporary, and that He is the “savior of all.” We see that, though
    the Israelites were “terrorized” by the poisonous serpents and that many of
    them died (Numbers 21:6), this punishment was a reminder of God’s salvation
    and served to not only teach the Israelites righteousness, but also
convinced their <em>enemies</em> that God is “the one who delivers from    <em>all evil</em>.”
</p>
<p>
    He delivers from <em>all evil</em> as the <em>savior of all</em>, and He
    uses judgments in order to convince <em>even his enemies</em> of those
    facts. Let that sink in…
</p>
<p>
If you do, it should strike you as extremely ironic that <em>Erasing Hell</em> claims 
<em>Wisdom</em> teaches that God is    <em>not the savior of all</em>, but simply doles out non-corrective
retributive punishment. The book itself clearly makes the exact    <em>opposite</em> claim. By divorcing Wisdom 16:1-2 from both its immediate
    context and its broader biblical allusions, Chan and Sprinkle distort its
    meaning in an attempt to defend the indefensible. Corrective punishment is
    clearly in view, not retributive punishment as they so boldly and
    incorrectly claim. <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Erasing Hell</em>
makes some other attempts to bolster its very weak case that    <em>kolasin </em>is retributive punishment, not corrective punishment. But
    all of these attempts are unconvincing and lacking in sound reasoning.
Primarily, they rely on either a misunderstanding of the Greek words    <em>aion</em> and <em>aionios</em> (which we have already discussed in some
    detail in earlier chapters) or on a lack of understanding of the biblical
    symbolism of fire (which we have also already discussed). For these
    reasons, and because this chapter is already getting to be excessively
    long, I will refrain from discussing these arguments here (though I may do
    so in another chapter at some point).
</p>
<p>
    But before we move on from <em>Erasing Hell</em>, there is one more claim
    worth addressing. You may recall that one of the authors states that “Part
    of me wants to believe that this is true” in regards to <em>kolasin </em>
    being corrective punishment, and that “this argument appears to reconcile
    God’s love with Jesus’ harsh words about hell.” There are three reasons why
    I think this should be addressed:
</p>
<p>
    1. This is a rhetorical device that may or may not be used honestly, and
    some people are overly persuaded by such devices. By stating that he “wants
    to believe this is true,” the author is attempting to present himself as
    being truthful in spite of his desires. This allows the audience to
    identify with him in such a way that would be impossible if he stated that
    he deeply longs to watch other people burn in torment (which would make him
    appear to be an immoral monster). It also engenders an implicit trust.
    After all, why would he go against his desire? It is important to recognize
    the power of such rhetorical devices in order to be able to evaluate
    evidence critically and soberly.
</p>
<p>
2. Although this <em>could </em>be a rhetorical device, perhaps it is <em>true</em> that “part of” the author “wants” <em>kolasin</em> to be
    corrective punishment. If so, I hope that the author will be humble and
    willing enough to examine the weaknesses of his own arguments and allow
    that part of himself the freedom to be honest. I would submit that the
    “part” of himself that he is describing is the compassionate, rational part that
    intuitively understands that a future of eternal conscious torment for
    billions of God’s children is wholly incompatible with the character of God
    as revealed by Jesus Christ. The part that is preventing him from seeing
    this truth fully, I think, is the part that is enslaved to tradition to the
    point that it is willing to deny and distort the clear evidence that
    corrective punishment is the precise meaning <em>kolasin</em>, as we have
    already demonstrated.
</p>
<p>
    3. The author is very nearly correct in stating that the argument for
    corrective punishment “appears to reconcile God’s love with Jesus’ harsh
    words about hell.” My only objection to his phrasing is the word “appears.”
    It does not just <em>appear</em> to reconcile God’s love and the punishment
    described by Jesus; it actually <em>does</em> reconcile those two truths
    perfectly.

    Perkins’ attempt
</h4>

    The following excerpt comes from an online essay entitled
    <em>

        >
            Punishment (kolasis, kolazein) – Eternal or Otherwise
        </a>
    &nbsp;</em>by Dr. Larry Perkins, Professor of Biblical Studies at Northwest Baptist
Seminary. It represents another attempt to cast doubt on the meaning of <em>kolasin</em> as corrective punishment. Instead, it portrays <em>kolasin</em> as having the sense of permanent or fatal punishment.
</p>
<blockquote>
    “In Ezekiel 14 and 18 the punishment that Yahweh brings upon Israel for its
    idolatry is death; in 44:12 Yahweh punishes the Levites for their
    participation in idolatry by never allowing them to act as priests in the
    new temple. It also occurs in Ezekiel 43:11 with the sense “receive their
    punishment” applied to Israel and describing Yahweh’s response to their
    sin. The prophet describes such punishment in 43:8 as “I wiped them out in
    my fury and by murder.” The emphasis seems to be upon a punishment that is
    fatal or results in permanent change, and administered by Yahweh, as divine
    agent, because of sinful action. The use of the verb in LXX Daniel 6:12a
    describes the punishment Daniel receives for praying to Yahweh, rather than
    to Darius, and his punishment is to be executed by confinement in a den of
    lions.”
</blockquote>

<p>
    The basic premise here is that <em>kolasin</em> seems to be used of fatal
    punishments and that this therefore indicates that <em>kolasin</em> is not
    corrective in nature but rather results in final, irreversible
    consequences.  Although this train of thought may seem compelling at a surface level, I think that it is ultimately unconvincing.  To see why, let’s first begin by analyzing
    Perkins' references to Ezekiel 14.
</p>
<p>
    The first three references to <em>kolasin</em> in Ezekiel 14 occur as part
    of a rather strange phrase in the Septuagint, translated as follows: “these
    men have conceived their devices in their hearts, and have set before their
    faces the punishment (<em>kolasin</em>) of their iniquities.” This phrase
    (with some slight variation between the three verses) occurs in Ezekiel
    14:3, 14:4, and 14:7. In most English translations it is rendered somewhat
    like the following: “these men have set up idols in their hearts and put
    wicked stumbling blocks before their faces” (Ezekiel 14:3 NIV). The term
    “stumbling block” is used instead of punishment for <em>kolasin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, it seems as if idolatry itself <em>is</em> the punishment
    (the <em>kolasin</em>) that these men were receiving. But this punishment
    is not purposeless in Ezekiel 14. Instead, it results in learning and
    restoration:
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 14:10-11 (NASB)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    They will bear the punishment<em> of</em> their iniquity; as the iniquity
    of the inquirer is, so the iniquity of the prophet will be,
    <strong>
        <em>in order</em> that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me and no
        longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Thus they will
        be My people, and I shall be their God
    </strong>
    ,”’ declares the Lord God.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    In several Bible versions (the NIV, ESV, NASB, NKJV etc.) this is
    delineated as the end of a section of Ezekiel’s thought. Although section
    headings are not found in the original text, this sectioning of the text
    does make sense since the focus shifts from a discussion of certain elders
    to a discussion of the judgment of Jerusalem as a city. The reason that I
    mention this is that the <em>only</em> references to <em>kolasin</em> in
Ezekiel 14 occur <em>prior </em>to this section break. And curiously,    <em>none</em> of these references to <em>kolasin</em> are described as
    resulting in death, <em>contrary</em> to Perkins’ claim. Instead the
    section ends with a statement of purpose: <em>kolasin </em>results in
    purification and restoration to right relationship.
</p>
<p>
    All of the references to deadly consequences are found in the following
section on the judgment of Jerusalem and <em>none of them</em> use the term    <em>kolasin</em> to describe these consequences. Instead the Septuagint
    uses the terms τιμωρήσομαι and εκδικήσεις to describe these punishments for
    Jerusalem. In short, the argument that <em>kolasin</em> must mean
    irreversible retributive punishment based on its usage in Ezekiel 14 is a
    failed one. It is not at all clear that <em>kolasin</em> is used to
    describe fatal punishment in context. Instead we see that <em>kolasin</em>
    occurred “in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from [God]
    and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions.”
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 18:30-32 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/sep/ezekiel/18.htm">
        Brenton Septuagint Translation</a>)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    I will judge you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord, each one according to
    his way: be converted, and turn from all your ungodliness, and it shall not
    become to you the punishment (<em>kolasin</em>) of iniquity. Cast away from
    yourselves all your ungodliness wherein ye have sinned against me; and make
    to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should ye die, O house
    of Israel? For I desire not the death of him that dies, saith the Lord.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This Septuagint translation is quite interesting for a number of reasons.
First, it is fascinating to see that unchecked ungodliness itself    <em>becomes the punishment (kolasin) of iniquity</em>. Growing away from
    God is its own punishment. This reminds me of Romans 1 in which the wrath
    of God is revealed, in which He turns people over to their sinful and
    depraved mindsets and they “<em>received</em> in themselves the due penalty
    for their error.”
</p>
<p>
    Another interesting aspect of this passage is that it is a warning of
    judgment with the intent to spur on repentance. It is not vindictive or
    hateful, but rather a sincere plea to Israel to turn from evil so they can
    obtain new hearts and new spirits. God does not desire or take pleasure in
    the death of <em>anyone</em>, but rather longs for repentance, showing us
    that his heart is one of love for all people.
</p>
<p>
    Third, if we look at the broader context of the chapter, we see that a
    person’s destiny is not fixed, but that they have multiple opportunities to
    repent.
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 18:21 (NIV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed
    and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will
    surely live; they will not die. None of the offenses they have committed
    will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have
    done, they will live. Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?
    declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from
    their ways and live?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “But if a righteous person turns from their righteousness and commits sin
    and does the same detestable things the wicked person does, will they live?
    None of the righteous things that person has done will be remembered.
    Because of the unfaithfulness they are guilty of and because of the sins
    they have committed, they will die.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Based on the context, it does not seem likely that the death being referred
    to is an immediate final sentence upon sinning. People seem to have
    multiple opportunities to turn toward good and turn toward evil. Death is
    the state that results from turning away from God and life is the state
    that results from turning toward God. This seems to mirror the concept that
    God “made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions”
    (Ephesians 2:5).
</p>
<p>
    God can move people from death to life, both figuratively and literally.
    This is one reason why even passages that explicitly describe literal death
    as a consequence for sin do not support Perkins’ thesis that divine
    punishment is final and non-corrective. In fact, after nearly every
    destructive and fatal judgment described for both Israel and the other
    nations in the book of Ezekiel, we see a corrective purpose. The refrain,
    “Then they will know that I am the LORD” is repeated (with some slight
    variations of equivalent meaning) about forty times in the book of Ezekiel,
    many of them following judgments that appear to be final (if we ignore
    God’s power to bring the dead to life). The purpose of these punishments is
    thus clearly delineated: they are meant to result in learning. In other
    words, they are corrective.
</p>
<p>
    But Perkins and others seem to ignore both the immediate context and the
    broader context of Ezekiel when they make claims that punishment is eternal
    and not corrective. Besides the repeated refrain following judgment that
    “then they will know” who God is, there is even more explicit evidence in
    Ezekiel that God’s judgments are purposeful and restorative. Consider
    Ezekiel 37, the vision of the valley of dry bones that Ezekiel sees after
    pronouncing so many crushing and fatal judgments on Israel and Judah.
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 37:9-14 (NASB)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say
    to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Come from the four winds, O
    breath, and breathe on <strong>these slain</strong>, that they come to
    life.”’” So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them,
    and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the    <strong>whole house of Israel</strong>; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are
    dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’ Therefore
    prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Behold,
    <strong>
        I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves</strong>, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.    <strong>Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your
        graves</strong>, My people.
    <strong>
        I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life,
    </strong>
and I will place you on your own land.<strong> Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and done it</strong>,” declares the Lord.’”
</blockquote>
<p>
    The claim that the fatal punishments of God in Ezekiel indicate retributive
    rather than corrective punishment is explicitly falsified by the book of
    Ezekiel itself. It is specifically those who were killed (“these slain”) in
    God’s judgments who are resurrected to new life. Though they assumed that
    they had no hope and were completely cut off from God’s love, they were
    wrong. God has the power over death and declares “I will open your graves
    and cause you to come up out of your graves.” The purpose is clear. The
    Israelites experienced judgment and death so that they will know that God
    is the LORD upon their resurrection, when he puts His Spirit within them.
    This resurrection to Spirit-filled life will be true for the “whole house
    of Israel” including those slain in judgment for their wickedness (indeed,
    these are specifically highlighted). This vision truly disallows the
    interpretation that any form of punishment (including <em>kolasin</em>) is 
	merely
    retributive in the book of Ezekiel. It is clear that the punishments of
    Israel are, once again, corrective and restorative, producing the knowledge
    of God and allowing for the resurrection to new life in the Spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Perkins also claims that God punishes the Levites in Ezekiel 44:13 by
    “never allowing them to act as priests in the new temple.” This, however,
    is hyperbole at best. Not a single English translation that I could find
    said that they would “never” be allowed to serve. Instead they all said
    that these Levites were “not” to serve as priests but rather to keep charge
    of the temple and take care of it. You can, and should, confirm this for
    yourself here:
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-13.htm">
        https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-13.htm
    </a>
    (you should also look at the preceding and following verse). By slipping in
    the word “never” where it does not occur, Perkin’s attempts to bolster his
    case that <em>kolasin</em> means permanent punishment. His use of it is
    therefore very suspect and strikes me as quite disingenuous.
</p>
<p>
    Besides this fact, however, is the reality that these Levites who
    participated in idol worship and “made the people of Israel fall into sin”
    (Ezekiel 44:12) are not cut off from God’s favor forever. In fact, we see
    that God, while causing them to “bear the consequences of their sin”
    (Ezekiel 44:10), still allows them to serve as priests, “having charge of
    the gates of the temple and serving in it,” slaughtering “the burnt
    offerings and sacrifices,” and standing before and serving the people
    (Ezekiel 44:11). They are only restricted from the most sacred of tasks,
    being forbidden to “come near to serve me as priests or come near any of my
    holy things or my most holy offerings” (Ezekiel 44:13). Can it really be
    argued that God is vindictively punishing these Levites by allowing them to
    serve in a limited capacity as priests after they led the people of Israel
    into egregious idolatry? Is it not more reasonable to see this punishment
    as corrective, teaching these priests that idolatry has consequences, but
    that God still forgives even the most heinous errors? Should we expect an
    immediate and complete restoration to the most sacred of tasks for the very
    people who led Israel to worship false gods without any consequence? I
    think not. But God in His mercy restores these priests in a limited
    capacity, so that they will learn what is right and not continue in error.
</p>
<p>
    The last Ezekiel reference Perkins makes in an attempt to bolster his claim is
    somewhat amusing, because it is a verse that we have already discussed
    above as indicative of the fact that <em>kolasin</em> has the sense of
    corrective punishment. Here it is again:
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 43:10-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
And thou, son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel,    <strong>that they may cease from their sins</strong>; and shew its aspect
and the arrangement of it. And they shall bear their    <strong>punishment (kolasis)</strong> for all the things that they have
    done: and thou shalt describe the house, and its entrances, and the plan
    thereof, and all its ordinances, and thou shalt make known to them all the
    regulations of it, and describe them before them:
    <strong>
        and they shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do
        them
    </strong>
    .<em> </em>(Brenton Septuagint Translation—available here:
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/sep/ezekiel/43.htm">
        https://biblehub.com/sep/ezekiel/43.htm
    </a>
    )
</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, it must be observed that the punishment (<em>kolasis</em>) that
    Israel must bear is in the context of learning to “cease from their sins”
    so that they “shall keep all my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do
    them.” Why someone would choose to use this verse to attempt to support the
    idea of retributive punishment is beyond me. Perhaps it is just an act of
    desperation. The punishment is, once again, clearly in the context of
    correction and training in righteousness. Attempting to argue otherwise is
    futile and demonstrates an extreme bias that is preventing an honest
    reading of the text.
</p>
<p>
    This is demonstrated by his attempt to use Ezekiel 43:8 as alleged proof
    that the <em>kolasis </em>referenced in Ezekiel 43:11 is retributive,
    claiming that it states that “I wiped them out in my fury and by murder.” I
    am still at a loss as to which Bible translation Perkins is using since
    again I could not find any version that sounded anything like this, which
    you can observe for yourself here:
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm">
        https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-8.htm
    </a>
    . None of them say anything about “murder.” Besides this fact, there are
    two other key considerations to have in mind:
</p>
<p>
    1. <em>Kolasin </em>is not found in any form in Ezekiel 43:8. He is
    therefore referencing the <em>kolasis </em>described in 43:11 (which we
    have already shown to be corrective).
</p>
<p>
    2. Even if <em>kolasin</em> were present, the context shows that the
    destruction meted out to Israel was corrective. To demonstrate this we need
    only to look also at the immediate context, including the very next verse.
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 43:8-9
</h3>
<blockquote>
    When they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts
    beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they defiled my
    holy name by their detestable practices. So I destroyed them in my anger.
    Now let them put away from me their prostitution and the funeral offerings
    for their kings, and I will live among them forever.
</blockquote>
<p>
    We see quite clearly that they experienced destruction so that they would
    then put away their prostitution and sinful offerings so that the LORD will
    “live among them forever.” Corrective punishment is undeniably in view. The
    same people who were destroyed were taught to abandon evil. And God
    promises that he <em>will </em>live among them forever. It is a certainty
    that the punishments experienced by those in sin will result in righteous
    life in the presence of God. At the risk of being repetitive, I will state
    the obvious once again: the punishment described is corrective and benefits
    the wicked by causing them to change their evil ways.
</p>
<p>Perkins' final reference is to Daniel 6:12.</p>
<h3>Daniel 6:12 (NIV)</h3> 
<blockquote>So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?” 
The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.” 
</blockquote>
<p>Initially, this reference completely baffled me since, as you can see, the English rendering of Daniel 6:12 makes no mention of the word “punishment” or any related word.&nbsp; 
Considering the possibility that Perkins may have been meaning to cite another verse in Daniel, I decided to search for words related to punishment on Bible Gateway. I looked in the NIV, ESV, KJV, NASB and NET versions and not one of them had any references to “punishment” or any related words that I could find in the entire book of Daniel.  I also examined the Hebrew text available on 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/daniel/6-12.htm">BibleHub </a>&nbsp;and 
found that there were no Hebrew words for punishment utilized in Daniel 6:12 or 
its vicinity.&nbsp; Additionally, I could not find <em>kolasin</em> in any of the versions of the Septuagint* 
that I examined. This led me to state, in an earlier rendering of this 
chapter, that <em>kolasis</em> is not found at all in the Septuagint in Daniel 
6:12. As it turns out, this is only partially true. An astute reader recently 
made me aware that there are <em>other</em> versions of the Septuagint that do contain the word <em>kolasis</em> and that it does not always occur in 6:12 due to different numbering conventions in certain versions of the Septuagint.  I am grateful to this reader for this information, as it explained the baffling conundrum of why Perkins would claim such a verse as evidence.  I would thank the reader personally but I am pretty sure that <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="50313e3f3e293d3f252310313e3f3e293d3f25237e313e3f3e">[email&#160;protected]</a> is not a real e-mail address.&nbsp; 
</p>
	<div class="box">
		*The Septuagint versions that I examined included the following (all hyperlinked for easy access): 
	<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/apostolic/daniel/6.htm">Apostolic 
	Bible Polyglot</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=50&amp;page=6">Elpenor's 
		Bilingual (Greek / English) Old Testament (Septuagint)</a> and the 
		<a href="http://www.apostoliki-diakonia.gr/bible/bible.asp?contents=old_testament/contents_Danihl.asp&amp;main=danihl&amp;file=49.6.htm">Septuagint</a> used by the Greek Orthodox Church published by Apostoliki Diakonia.  None of these versions contain any reference to <em>kolasin</em> in Daniel 6, as you can verify for yourself.  In case you are not sure what to look for, here is what the root of the word kolasin (and its forms) looks like in Greek letters: κολα.
		The aforementioned reader, however, notified me of a different version (the Rahlfs/Hanhart edition) that 
		contains κολάσῃς in verse 13b that is available 
		<a href="https://www.academic-bible.com/en/online-bibles/septuagint-lxx/read-the-bible-text/bibel/text/lesen/stelle/27/60001/69999/ch/b9630a9eacc3f6a5e8076e2babd529eb/">here.</a>  Given that the Septuagint is a <em>translation</em> of the Hebrew* scriptures, however, it seems quite odd to me that some versions contain <em>kolasis</em> when there appears to be no parallel for this word in the Hebrew Masoretic text, which you can verify for yourself 
		<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/daniel/6-12.htm">here</a>. This is probably why no English version that I examined contained any reference to "punishment" in Daniel.  </div>
<blockquote>*Adding to the complexity of this issue, the book of Daniel appears to have been written in both Hebrew and Aramaic originally, with Daniel 6 being part of the Aramaic section.</blockquote>
<p>All this to say that Perkins' argument on Daniel 6:12 is not as bad as it 
originally appeared to me (since based on the Septuagint versions I had studied, he appeared to be fabricating the usage of <em>kolasin</em> and then using circular reasoning to prove it's meaning based on a text in which it did not exist).  Nevertheless, I still think that his argument that <em>kolasin</em> must refer to retributive punishment is very weak, for a number of reasons.&nbsp;  </p>
	<p>The first is that is must not be forgotten that numerous Greek thinkers have explicitly defined <em>kolasin</em> as corrective, and much of its usage indicates corrective punishment as its meaning, as we saw in the earlier sections of this essay.  By contrast, there is never, to my knowledge, any instance in ancient Greek literature where <em>kolasin</em> is expressly <em>defined</em> as retributive punishment.  Therefore, at best, the claim could be made that retributive or vengeful punishment could <em>also</em> be part of <em>kolasin's</em> semantic range (range of meaning).  It cannot be reasonably claimed that retributive punishment is it's <em>only</em> 
	possible meaning, since there is far too much contradictory evidence to take 
	such a claim seriously. Nevertheless, there seems to be an unwarranted insistence that <em>kolasin</em>	<em>must</em> mean purely retributive punishment.  Such an insistence runs counter to the facts.</p>
	<p>Context is another reason why Daniel 6 is a poor proof text for attempting to demonstrate 
	<em>kolasin's</em> meaning as retributive vengeance.  It must be remembered that in Daniel 6, it is the envious, conniving opponents of Daniel who are deceiving the king into making a law against worshipping God, so that they could get Daniel killed.   It is these vengeful, immoral men who are seeking the "punishment" of the lions' den for Daniel.  For this reason, it seems foolhardy to insist that their usage of 
	<em>kolasin</em> in a retributive sense trumps the clear definitions and usages of so many other Greek writers.  This is especially true since, unlike the <em>righteous</em> judgments of God, their purpose in pursuing <em>kolasin</em> for Daniel was <em>not righteous at all</em>, but rather demonstrably wicked and perverse.   This, of course, begs the question of whether it is appropriate to assert that Christ was using <em>kolasin</em> in the same way as these evil men, rather than in the sense of corrective punishment, which seems to be better attested by much more reliable sources.  
</p>
<p>This raises another important point.  Even if there are examples in which <em>kolasin</em> appears to be used of retributive punishment (and there certainly are some), it is vital to consider the context and especially the character of the individual using the term.  Since the Bible tells us that God is love, that His mercy endures forever, and that He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, it makes far more sense to believe that He is using <em>kolasin</em> in its dominant sense of corrective punishment, rather than retributive vengeance.   Jesus was not vengeful, but rather cried out "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" while being brutally crucified.  Can anyone honestly claim that He <em>must have meant</em> retributive vengeance in light of who He demonstrated Himself to be?</p>
<h4>
    Misuses of <em>Kolasin</em>
</h4>
<p>
    I imagine that you are seeing by now that the case for <em>kolasin</em> as
    corrective punishment is very strong and the case against this view is very
    weak. This being said, I think it is necessary to say that I think that
    Barclay’s claim that the distinction between terms for punishment “is
    always observed” is a bit of an overstatement. It seems to be observed very
    often, but I have found some cases where it was not (such as the one from certain versions of the Septuagint in Daniel above). For this
    reason, and in the interest of honesty, I will now address one other instance in
    which <em>kolasin</em> is used in such a way that it does not seem
    corrective. These examples, however, seem to stem from a lack of semantic precision. As Aulus Gellius
    intimates, not everyone uses the Greek terms for punishment with precision.
    Instead there are “those who have made a more exact differentiation between
    terms of this kind” and implicitly, those who have not. One example of such
    imprecise usage that demonstrates a lack of distinction between terms for
    punishment can be found in Lucian of Samosata’s <em>Phalaris</em>.
</p>
<p>
    A little background is in order to understand this work and its usage of
    various forms of <em>kolasin</em>. First, Phalaris is a Greek tyrant from 
	the sixth century BC who was infamous for his cruelty. In this work, the 
	renowned satirist, Lucian, is writing a mock defense hundreds of years after 
	Phalaris' death, as if he were Phalaris. The work is therefore written from 
	Phalaris' point of view, although it is generally assumed that Lucian is 
	actually making fun of Phalaris' sick and perverse sense of justice.&nbsp; 
	Nevertheless, Phalaris is attempting to explain that he
    is not in fact cruel, but rather good and just. As part of his explanation,
    he tells the men of Delphi, to whom he is sending a brazen bull (an
    instrument of sadistic torture), the story of the bull.
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, he explains that the inventor of the brazen bull, Perilaus,
    brought it to him thinking that he would like it since he was known for
    enjoying torture. The brazen bull, Perilaus explains, slowly cooks its
    victims while transforming their screams into musical notes that can be
    listened to as they are torturously killed. Phalaris defends his honor
    to the men of Delphi by explaining that he was indignant and repulsed by
    such a device. Therefore, he tricks Perilaus to enter the device himself to
    demonstrate its musical properties, then locks him in and begins to roast
    him. After some time of torturing the man, he throws him, still alive, off
    of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this tale, both Perilaus and Phalaris use forms of the words <em>kolasin</em> or <em>kolazo </em>throughout. Admittedly, they do not
    seem to be using this in its typical sense of “corrective punishment.” It
    is, however, quite easy to explain why—both of these men are quite
    obviously psychotic and cruel. One created the device and the other used
    it. Both plainly have a skewed sense of justice and perverse understanding
    of righteous <em>kolasin</em>. It is undoubtedly absurd to take our cues as
    to the meaning of <em>kolasin </em>from a vicious tyrant and from the
    inventor of one of the most notorious ancient torture devices (especially since these uses come from a work of satire meant to emphasize Phalaris' twisted sense of morality), rather than
    from the explicit definitions set forth by the great thinkers and church
    fathers that we have already seen.
</p>
<p>
    We know that people frequently misuse words, especially if they are
    distorting them for evil purposes. To claim the use of <em>kolasin</em> as
    cruel torture in <em>Phalaris</em> as proof of its meaning would be like
    claiming the definition of “discipline” is “to beat your child senseless”
    because it is used in such a manner by an abusive father. Such a father
    should <strong>not</strong> be considered an accurate source of information
    on discipline. Rather, it should be understood that he is giving a
    distorted and perverse definition because of his own twisted perspective.
    This being said, what type of Father is God? Is he a wicked Father who
    mercilessly beats his children beyond death and into eternity? The biblical
    answer is an emphatic “NO!”
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
To summarize, we have seen that <em>kolasin</em> is clearly defined as    <em>corrective</em> punishment by many Greek-speaking thinkers, secular and
    Christian, from before Christ and after Christ, over an approximately
    800-year time span at least. The claim that punishment benefits the sinner
    by causing them to reform is clearly laid out by Plato, Aristotle, Aulus
    Gellius, the Septuagint, Clement of Alexandria, Epiphanius, and Methodius,
    and hinted at by Theophrastus’ botanical use of the word as pruning. Some
    of the Christian thinkers even make it clear that all forms of punishment
    (not just <em>kolasin</em>) in the hands of a just God, are curative of the
    disease of wickedness in the sinner. This view of punishment reconciles
    Jesus' clear claims that God loves his enemies with his judgment of evil.
    God’s justice is no longer viewed as a distinct attribute in opposition to
    his love, but rather as an outflow of his love through which he reconciles
    the world to Himself, even His enemies. God does not ask us to forgive but
    refuse to do so himself. He does not misleadingly claim that His love never
    fails; it really never fails!
</p>
<p>
    Coming against all of this evidence and reason, we have those who, in an
    attempt to promote the traditional view, distort and decontextualize
    numerous sources, or simply argue that inconclusive examples of usage prove that it <em>must</em> be retributive, when such examples have no power to do so.  
    We have also seen numerous attempts to claim <em>kolasin</em> as
    retributive punishment when a closer look at the context <em>demands</em>
    that we come to the opposite conclusion of corrective punishment. It seems
    that these authors are so steeped in tradition that they are missing the
    obvious meaning of the word in context and choosing to ignore the explicit
    definitions set forth by many of the greatest thinkers of the
    Greek-speaking world. 
</p>
	<p>
    They also are forgetting that God has the power over
    death and can use even such a punishment to reform. Jesus holds the keys to death and Hades and came to set the captives free, even those slain by his judgments, no matter how hopeless their cases seem or how dry their bones are.  He is able to literally kill and then make alive, but also figuratively, for which reason Peter tells us “He himself bore
our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness” (1
    Peter 2:24). We also see that we are baptized into Christ’s death (Romans
    6:3) and that a seed cannot bear fruit until it falls to the ground and
    dies (John 12:24). Such references to death are quite abundant and show
    that death is not an insurmountable obstacle but rather a tool “devised for
    the sake of conversion” by a loving God (as stated by Methodius and
    Epiphanius).
</p>
<p>
God describes himself to us as a loving Father. In His hands,    <em>kolasin</em> must be a corrective tool used to discipline and heal.
    This is the only reasonable conclusion. It is demanded by reason, it is
    demanded by His character, and it is demanded by the evidence.

<p>
    Ὠφελοῦνται ἄρα οἱ κρινόμενοι. ἀναιρεῖται γὰρ αὐτῶν ταῖς βασάνοις ἡ πονηρία
    κωλυομένη, καθάπερ καὶ πρὸς τῶν ἰατρῶν τομαῖς καὶ φαρμάκοις αἱ νόσοι. τὸ
    γὰρ ἀδικοῦντα διδόναι δίκην ἐπανορθοῦσθαι τὴν ψυχήν ἐστι, τὴν μεγάλην νόσον
    ἀδικίαν ἀποβάλλοντα.
</p>
<p>
    Ὡμολόγει.
</p>
<p>
    Τί δέ; οὐ κατὰ ἀναλογίαν τῶν ἁμαρτηθέντων τὰς κολάσεις τοῖς κολαζομένοις
    δικαίως προσφέρεσθαι φῄς, καθάπερ καὶ τοῖς ἰατρευομένοις κατὰ ἀναλογίαν τῶν
    τραυμάτων τὰς χειρουργίας;
</p>
<p>
    Ἐπένευσεν.
</p>
<p>
    Οὐκοῦν ὁ μὲν δράσας ἄξια θανάτου τιμᾶται θανάτῳ τὴν δίκην, ὁ δὲ πληγῶν
    πληγαῖς, ὁ δὲ δεσμῶν δεσμοῖς;
</p>
<p>
    Ὡμολόγει.
</p>
<p>
    Ζημιοῦται δὲ ὁ ὀφλήσας, ἔφην, δεσμοῖς ἢ πληγαῖς ἢ ἄλλῃ τινὶ τοιαύτῃ
    τιμωρίᾳ, ὅπως παύσηται μεταγνοὺς τοῦ ἀδικεῖν, ξύλον καθάπερ διεστραμμένον
    βασάνοις εὐθυνόμενος;
</p>
<p>
    Ἀληθέστατα, ἔφη, λέγεις.
</p>
<p>
    Τιμωρεῖται γὰρ αὐτὸν οὐ τοῦ παρεληλυθότος ἐγκλήματος ἕνεκα ὁ δικαστής, ἀλλὰ
    τοῦ μέλλοντος, ὅπως μὴ καὶ αὖθις ποιήσῃ τοῦτο.
</p>
<p>
    Δῆλον, ἔφη.
