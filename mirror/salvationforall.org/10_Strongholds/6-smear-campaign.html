<h1>
    The Smear Campaign
</h1>
<p>
    On July 4<sup>th</sup>, 2018, the website <em>Desiring God</em> published
    an interview with Michael McClymond entitled “Universalism Distorts the
    Grace of God.” The interviewer defined universalism as the “theology that
    says all people will be saved in the end.” Despite the fact that
    universalism is a controversial label that I tend to avoid because it can
    be easily misunderstood, I cannot deny that I would be a Christian
    universalist by this definition. So, the claim that universalism distorts
    the grace of God caught my eye. Naturally, I was curious to see in what
    sense they believed this to be the case. I was in for quite a surprise.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is not a biblically-based argument at all. Only one verse is
    partially quoted: “For God so loved the world” (John 3:16), and it has
    little, if any, relevance to his claims.
</p>
<p>
    Besides this, McClymond, who wrote a “massive two-volume, 1,400-page work
    titled
    <em>
        The Devil’s Redemption: A New History and Interpretation of Christian
        Universalism
    </em>does not seem to know anything about <em>Christian</em> universalism, 
	at least not in the biblical form I have been describing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Perhaps this is simply due to a lack of knowledge, or having researched the 
	wrong sources that encouraged his confirmation bias. At any rate, he neatly
    summarizes the conclusions of his research into the topic for us, so you
    can save yourselves 1,400 pages worth of time: his representations of
    Christian universalism, whether well-intentioned or not, are false and misleading. The claims he makes bear
    no resemblance to anything that we have discussed in the pages of this
    website or anything I’ve read from any Christian universalist at all.
    Instead, they constitute more of a smear campaign that sadly will prevent
    many people from doing any honest research into the topic for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    We will now examine his claims. Decide for yourself if he is accurately
    representing the view that we have presented thus far.
</p>
<h4>
    Claim #1
</h4>
<p>
    Here is a quote of his first claim:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		To my surprise, I found that from ancient times onward — beginning with the
    gnostics of the second and third century, then Jewish and Christian
    Kabbalah, and then some of the so-called esoteric views in modern esoteric
    theories — I found that there was a concept of God insisting that he is not
    independent of the world. God is dependent upon the world. Or God created
    the world in order to evolve in and through the world.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		It’s almost like God was a spirit in need of a body, and the world became
    his body. God is enriched then through the world. In essence it says, “In
    the beginning, God is incomplete. By creating the world, he completes
    himself.” It’s almost like God and the world are married to one another …
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		This is a view that is unworthy of God.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    To <em>my</em> surprise, a person who wrote 1,400 pages on the “error” of
    Christian universalism begins by referencing non-Christian worldviews (the
Gnostics and Jewish Kabbalah, for example) as proofs that <em>Christian</em> universalism distorts God’s grace. I have never read
    anyone say that God is “dependent upon the world” or that he “created the
    world in order to evolve in and through the world,” or that “God was a
    spirit in need of a body, and the world became his body.” Who ever said
    that “in the beginning, God is incomplete” or that “God and the world are
    married to one another”? I agree with McClymond that such views are
    unworthy of God, but I do not see where he is getting these views from.
</p>
	<p>
    Like I said, I have read quite a bit on this topic, and I have    <em>never</em> seen <em>anyone</em> make the claims that he is attacking.
    Perhaps <em>someone</em> has, but this can scarcely be touted as
    representative of Christian universalism, which is founded in clear
    biblical statements and a very high view of Christ’s work on the cross.
    McClymond should know this and give an accurate representation that at
    least acknowledges this fact, rather than present the ideas he does
    (without citing where he got them). The ideas he presents certainly would
    make Christian universalism <em>sound very weird</em>, but they are, at
    best, a misrepresentation of the position. But perhaps misrepresentation is
    the goal – if you can make the view sound strange enough, people won’t
    investigate the truth for themselves. A successful smear campaign does not
    require facts, just skewed perceptions.
</p>
	<div class="box">
		To be fair, I am not claiming, as a matter of fact, that McClymond is <em>
intentionally</em> misrepresenting Christian universalism.&nbsp; It is possible 
that he has simply focused his research on completely different sources than I 
have.&nbsp; So, in the interest of shedding more light on the subject, I am 
going to begin compiling a growing list of useful resources that can be used by 
		anyone interested in finding the truth (McClymond included, I hope) to 
		evaluate the facts.</div>
<h4>
    Claim #2
</h4>
<p>
    McClymond goes on to claim that there are <em>only</em> four rationales for
    salvation given by universalist thinkers. He says that “when you look at
    the reason, the rationale, given by the different universalist thinkers for
    salvation, you end up, in just about every case, undermining the principle
    of grace.” Before we get into the four “Christian universalist” rationales
    he proposes, think back on the reasoning we have discussed so far. What are
    the reasons we have discussed in these pages? Don’t skip the thinking – it
    is important.
</p>
<p>
    Now, that you have thought about the reasons I have presented for the
    ultimate salvation of all people, consider the reasons given by McClymond
    as the <em>only</em> four. You’ll see that his conclusions are, once again,
    false:
</p>
<h4>
    McClymond’s Four Universalist Rationales (directly quoted)
</h4>
<p>
    1. McClymond: “There is a universalism that says, ‘I am saved because I am
    divine.’ That’s the hardcore gnostic idea. We have the divinity within us.”
</p>
<p>
    My response on reading this: “What! Who says that? It is because of God’s
    divinity—because He is sovereign, willing, and able to save that we will be
    saved. It is purely by His grace.”
</p>
<p>
    2. McClymond: “There’s another version of universalism: ‘I am saved because
    I’m human.’”
</p>
<p>
    My response on reading this: “What is this guy talking about? We are saved
    because Jesus is the Savior of all people as the Bible tells us, not
    because of anything intrinsic about us. It’s because of His finished work
    on the cross and His resurrection.”
</p>
<p>
    3. McClymond: “There’s another version of universalism that says, ‘I am
    saved because I suffer.’”
</p>
<p>
    My response on reading this: “Where is he getting this stuff from?
    Suffering may take place as discipline (even for Christians as described in
    Hebrews 12), but that is not what saves us. We are saved by Christ, not by
    our experiences or sufferings.”
</p>
<p>
    4. McClymond: “The <em>only</em> other version of universalism that’s left
    to try to preserve grace is just to say, ‘I am saved because God will
    reverse every choice I made.’ This is the idea that everyone, at the moment
    they die — even the mass murderer who’s shooting down his victims, and
    suddenly he’s shot dead — just goes immediately to be with God. God changes
    their character at the moment of death. That’s sometimes called
    ultra-universalism because it holds that everyone goes immediately to be
    with God.”
</p>
<p>
    My response on reading this: “Wow. This whole article completely
    misrepresents the view that all will be saved by God. Nobody I’ve ever read
    suggests that we instantaneously have our character changed at the moment
    of death, so that mass murderers go straight to heaven. This completely
    ignores the biblical principle that every person will be judged according
    to what they have done. Judgment <em>does occur</em> in true, biblical
    Christian universalism. This guy has not discussed biblical Christian
    universalism at all. I wonder if he’s misrepresenting it on purpose or if
    he’s just really uninformed. Perhaps this rebuttal will help him to see the
    truth of the matter.”
</p>
<p>
He explains, for each of these reasons (which he claims to be the    <em>only</em> ones), why they distort God’s grace. You can read the
    interview for yourself to see why. But I’m not going to waste any time
    evaluating his explanations (which I tend to agree with) for why those
views distort God’s grace, because those are    <em>not at all the reasons for believing in universal salvation. </em>If
    you have been reading this website and paying attention at all, you should
    notice that none of these rationales even remotely resemble the reasons
    that have been given for why Jesus’ death and resurrection ultimately
    restores everyone to a right relationship with God. I have read several
    books on the topic, carefully examined the writings of the early church
fathers, dug deeply into the Bible and into history, and I have    <em>never once</em> seen the ideas presented above as rationales for
    salvation.
</p>
<p>
    In short, McClymond’s representation is actually an astonishing
    misrepresentation. It is a straw man that is easy to tear down, but in no
    way represents the view you have been reading about here. Strongly
    reminiscent of the types of political ads that infest the airwaves come
    election time, his depiction of Christian universalism seems more like a
    smear campaign than careful scholarly research. Sadly, however, it is
    likely that it will <em>work</em>. People will assume that this scholar
    has thoroughly investigated the topic and is making accurate
    representations of its lunacy. “Those universalists sound like a bunch of
    unscriptural nutcases,” they will say, “We’d better <em>not</em>
    investigate for ourselves to see if these claims are true or else we might 
	get deceived.” And that, unfortunately is usually all that is needed.&nbsp; 
	I know, because I too spent most of my life leaning on the authority of 
	those who claimed biblical expertise and cried "heresy" and "danger" about 
	any view that differed from their own rather than investigating the facts 
	for myself.
</p>
<p>
    The fact of the matter, however, is that the rationale for the ultimate
    salvation of all people is deeply scriptural and based on a high view of
    Christ and of God’s power and love as clearly described therein. We have
    spent a great deal of time detailing this already, so I will simply direct
    you to look up some of the biblical passages again. Here is a list (albeit
    an incomplete one) of some of the most important ones: 1 John 2:2, 1
    Corinthians 15:20-28, 2 Corinthians 5:14-19, Colossians 1:15-20,
    Philippians 2:9-11, Romans 14:11, Isaiah 45:23, Romans 10:9, , 1 Timothy
    4:9-10, 1 Timothy 2:3-6, John 12:32, Romans 3:22-24, Romans 5:18, Romans
    11:32, Luke 3:6, John 1:29, 1 John 4:14, Ephesians 1:7-10, Isaiah 49:6,
    Daniel 7:13-14, Revelation 5:13, and many more).
</p>
<p>
    This is likely why a respected scholar in this field,
    <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/ilaria-l-e-ramelli">
        Ilaria Ramelli
    </a>
    &nbsp;(following nearly 15 years of painstaking scholarly research), concludes
that the early church fathers who espoused the restoration of all things (<em>apokatastasis </em>in Greek) “grounded their Christian doctrine of<em> apokatastasis </em>first of all in the Bible” (<em>The Christian Doctrine of Apokatastasis</em> 2013 p. 11) and in the
    view of Christ as truly the Savior of the world. She expounds on this as
    follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The doctrine of apokatastasis, as is found, from the New Testament to
    Eriugena, in many Christian texts and Patristic authors, is a Christian
    doctrine and is grounded in Christ … Indeed, the Christian doctrine of
    apokatastasis is based on the incarnation, death, and resurrection of
    Christ, and on God’s being the supreme Good. It is also founded upon God’s
    grace, which will “bestow mercy upon all,” and the divine will—which these
    Patristic authors saw as revealed by Scripture—“that all humans be saved
    and reach the knowledge of Truth.” They also considered it to be revealed
    in Scripture, and in particular in a prophecy by St. Paul, that in the
    telos [end], when all the powers of evil and death will be annihilated and
    all enemies will submit (for Origen and his followers, in a voluntary
    submission), “God will be all in all.” The apokatastasis doctrine is
    historically very far from having been produced by an isolated character,
    excessively influenced or even “contaminated” by Greek theories, such as
Origen has been long considered to be. (Ramelli, <em>The Christian Doctrine of Apokatastasis </em>2013, 
		p. 817)</blockquote>

</div>
<p>
    Ramelli rightly concludes that the ultimate salvation of all people in
    early Christian writings is based on Christ’s incarnation, death, and
resurrection, not on any of the four straw men presented in the <em>Desiring God </em>interview. The understanding of Jesus as the actual
    Savior of the whole world is firmly rooted in Scripture (from which she
    quotes several times). God’s grace, goodness, and mercy are viewed as
    greater than most modern churches allow, not in spite of the Bible, but
    because of it. It was widely believed in the early church for at least 500
    years, especially by those who were most knowledgeable of Scripture in its
    original languages, and was not the result of pagan influence. On this last
    point, Ramelli clarifies its origins as uniquely Judeo-Christian:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“The doctrine of apokatastasis as the eventual universal salvation is an
    authentically Christian, or Jewish-Christian, doctrine. Before
    Christianity, no religion or philosophy had ever maintained it, not even
    Plato or mystery religions.” (Ibid. p. 819)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Not only this, universal salvation was used to defend the Christian faith
    against attacks from the most significant heresies that came against the
    early church:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“In fact, the main Patristic supporters of this theory, Origen and Nyssen,
    did support it in defence of Christian “orthodoxy,” against those which
    were regarded as the most dangerous heresies of their times, as I have
    argued: Origen supported it against “Gnosticism” and Marcionism, and
    Gregory against “Arianism.” (Ibid. p. 823)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The understanding that all would eventually be saved from sin and death as
    a result of the complete success of Jesus’ atoning death and resurrection
    was actually used in apologetics to defend Christianity. In fact, in
    addition to describing universal restoration to defend orthodoxy against
    heterodox views of Christian origin, it was also used to defend against the
    accusations of pagan philosophers. Origen’s <em>Against Celsus, </em>for
    example, explains the purifying nature of the fire of God to refute Celsus’
    accusations that the Christian God was cruel and “coming down like a
    torturer bearing fire” (<em><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04164.htm">Contra Celsum</a>
    </em>
    <em>, Book IV, </em>
    Chapter 13). The scriptural basis for viewing fire as purifying is
    extremely strong, as we have already seen, but largely ignored by most
    churches. This is unfortunate, because it would <em>still</em> serve to
    defend the Christian faith if we were better able to explain such biblical
    symbols to those who share Celsus’ misgivings and therefore have doubts
    about God’s character. We could remove this stumbling block by simply being
    more informed on the full counsel of Scripture and the common meanings of
    its symbolic language, rather than insisting that the fire of God is only a
    descriptor of pain and anguish (which is something it <em>never</em>
    symbolizes as far as I can tell).
</p>
<h4>
    Claim #3
</h4>
<p>
    The final claim made in the <em>Desiring God</em> interview that is worth
    addressing demonstrates two key misunderstandings. I think that these
    misunderstandings are probably quite prevalent, and for this reason, it is
    important to clear them up. Here is his claim:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Either you hold to ultra-universalism, which empties our moral choices of
    meaning, or else you suffer to make expiation or atonement for your own
    sins. In that case, you undermine grace. There isn’t a good answer in terms
    of universalism.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    So, to summarize, McClymond is asserting that there are only two choices if
    one holds to the belief that all will eventually experience salvation:
</p>
<p>
    1. Ultra-universalism in which our moral choices become meaningless.
</p>
<p>
    Or
</p>
<p>
    2. Atoning for our own sins through suffering.
</p>
<p>
    This is a false dichotomy. Although presented as the only choices, neither
    of them are true options. And although he claims that “there isn’t a good
answer in terms of universalism,” in reality there are    <em>very good scriptural answers</em> that refute his claims.
</p>
<h4>
    False Choice #1: Ultra-universalism
</h4>
<p>
    First, “ultra-universalism” is not really a biblical option. The Bible is
    quite clear that our moral choices do matter. If anything, the view I have
been presenting makes our moral choices    <em>more significant, not less significant</em>. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
    I have heard a message very similar to the following one countless times:
</p>
<p>
    “Do you know where you’ll go if you die tonight? Say this prayer and ask
    Jesus into your heart, and you can know without a doubt that you will go to
    heaven when you die.”
</p>
<p>
    Have you ever heard a similar message?
</p>
<p>
    Although I think these messages are delivered with good intentions, they
    actually cause our moral choices to lose meaning. It does not matter how
    you live in such a scenario; you have your ticket to heaven. Jesus,
    however, does not assure us that we will enter the kingdom of heaven based
    on our claims of belief nor based on reciting a sinner’s prayer. Obedience
    matters:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 7:21-23
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of
heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.    <strong><sup> </sup></strong>Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord,
    did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in
    your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never
    knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is apparent that those whom Jesus rejects from the kingdom are very
    religious, and very surprised that they are not waltzing in. They even
    describe their impressive credentials (prophesying, casting out demons and
    performing miracles in Jesus’ name). “Of course we will get in,” they
    think, “look at how religious we have been.” And yet, Jesus rejects them.
    Why?
</p>
<p>
    The reason is clear: they did not do the will of God, they did not obey.
    Instead, they did evil.
</p>
<p>
    The inquisitor who “exorcised” demons using sadistic torture devices.
</p>
<p>
    The crusader who raped, pillaged, and murdered on his route to recapture
    the holy land.
</p>
<p>
    The reformer who burned his enemies at the stake or had dissenting
    Anabaptists drowned in a river in mockery.
</p>
<p>
    All done in Jesus’ name, or so they claimed. But were they really obeying
    Jesus? Or were they evildoers?
</p>
<p>
    Our choices matter.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I’m not saying that these people are forever damned because of their
    choices. God’s love can soften even the hardest heart. But it does seem
    that those who persist in doing evil, regardless of their religious claims,
    miss out on the wedding feast. The doors are shut, and there is weeping and
    regret (see Matthew 25:1-13).
</p>
<p>
    A wedding feast, however, is not the end, but the promise of a new
    beginning. It is a celebration that <em>by its very nature</em> celebrates what is
    to come: the marriage. Missing out on the feast does not mean that there is
    no hope for the future. God is still reconciling the world to himself.
    Jesus is still the Savior of all people. The gates to the New Jerusalem
    never shut and Christ and the church continue to beckon to those outside to
    come and drink the water of life. Ultimately, God will be all in all, even
    if the wicked devastatingly miss the feast. But, in order to be counted as
    good and faithful servants, we have to be both good and faithful. Our moral
    decisions have profound significance.
</p>
<h4>
    False Choice #2: Atoning for Our Own Sins
</h4>
<p>
    The second false choice presented by McClymond is that people would have to
    atone for their own sins through suffering if universalism were true. He is
    right that this would distort grace, but wrong that it is the only
    alternative to “ultra-universalism.” The key misunderstanding here is the
    assumption that suffering, or discipline is equivalent to atonement. This,
    however, is not the reason for experiencing discipline or suffering at all.
    Instead, suffering produces sanctification. It is a tool that helps us to
    grow in holiness and refines our character. Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    1 Peter 4:1-2
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the
same attitude, because    <strong>whoever suffers in the body is done with sin</strong>. As a result,
    they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires,
    but rather for the will of God.
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Peter 4:12-17a
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Dear friends, do not be surprised at the    <strong>fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you</strong>, as though
something strange were happening to you. But rejoice inasmuch as you    <strong>participate in the sufferings of Christ</strong>, so that you may
    be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted because of the
    name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests
    on you. If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other
kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. However, if you    <strong>suffer</strong> as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God
that you bear that name.    <strong> For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household</strong>
    …
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Peter 4:19
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		So then, those who <strong>suffer</strong> according to God’s will
    <em>
        should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do
        good.
    </em>
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Hebrews 12:4-11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of
    shedding your blood. And have you completely forgotten this word of
encouragement that    <strong>addresses you as a father addresses his son</strong>? It says,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s <strong>discipline</strong>,
	
		<br>and do not lose heart when he <strong>rebukes</strong> you,<strong><br>because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,</strong>
    <strong><br>and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son</strong>.”&nbsp;

</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Endure hardship as <strong>discipline;</strong>    <strong>God is treating you as his children</strong>. For what children are
not <strong>disciplined</strong> by their father? If you are not<strong> disciplined</strong>—    <strong><em>and everyone undergoes discipline</em></strong>—then you are
    not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. Moreover, we have all
    had human fathers who <strong>disciplined</strong> us and we respected them
    for it.
    <em>
How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and        <strong>live</strong>!
    </em>
    They <strong>disciplined</strong> us for a little while as they thought
    best; but
    <strong>
        God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his
        holiness
    </strong>
. No <strong>discipline</strong> seems pleasant at the time, but    <strong>painful</strong>. Later on, however,
    <strong>
        it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have
        been trained by it
    </strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Romans 5:3-5
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Not only that, but we rejoice in our <strong>sufferings</strong>, knowing
that <strong>suffering produces endurance, <sup> </sup>and endurance produces character, and character produces hope</strong>, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured
    into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, all of these passages are addressed <em>to believers</em>, and all of
    them encourage believers to see suffering and hardship as
    character-building discipline. <em>Judgment</em> begins with the house of
    God, and it is a <em>fiery</em> trial. This obviously contradicts the
    notion that our suffering <em>atones</em> for sin. It does not. Otherwise,
    it would have to be the case that believers atone for their sins when they
    suffer. But this is nonsense. <em>Jesus</em> is the atoning sacrifice for 
	the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2). This is why He said “it is finished” 
	immediately before his death (John 19:30). The atonement for sin is absolutely and totally complete. No one ever
    has to <em>atone</em> for their sin, because this has already been done.
</p>
<p>
    People do, however, need to grow in holiness and discard their sinful ways
    and mindsets, whether they profess to be Christian or not. Discipline,
    judgment, and suffering work to accomplish this end of making us all more
    like Christ. They are, in fact, indicators that we are God’s children and
that He is our Father. These facts are asserted to be true    <em>for all of us</em> by Acts 17:28 and Malachi 2:10 at the very least. So
    you see, the claim that post-mortem discipline means that people must
    suffer to atone for their sins is false. This discipline and chastisement
    does not take away from Jesus’ complete atonement any more than the fact
    that Christians still suffer does.
</p>
<p>
    Nobody atones for their own sin, period. But God does not leave us in a
    state of wickedness forever; His judgment is cathartic, healing, and
beneficial. It is painful, but it transforms us. He wounds and    <em>then</em> He heals, He kills and <em>then</em> He makes alive
    (Deuteronomy 32:39, Hosea 6:1, Job 5:18, Isaiah 30:26, 1 Samuel 2:6).
</p>
<h4>
    The Biblical Choice: Grace and Cleansing Judgment
</h4>
<p>
    The scriptural answer that McClymond neglects to mention is has two
    complementary parts:
</p>
<p>
    1. God has bestowed his grace freely on all people through Christ, who is a
    ransom for all. He redeemed us, buying everyone back from the power of sin
    and death as the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. Through
    Christ, God is reconciling the world to himself—everything and everyone
    (see 1 Timothy 2:2-6, 1 John 2:2, Colossians 1:20, and many more)
</p>
<p>
    2. God is refining and transforming those He purchased back. He is making
    us all more like Him. This is a process, often called sanctification. It
    involves suffering and pain because that is how we learn character, as we
    saw in the many verses above. I think most people, as they mature, begin to
    realize this truth about human beings—we do not learn by having everything
    be easy; we grow because of the hard stuff, the losses, and the trials. God
    does not give up on unbelievers at the point of death, but continues to
    pursue their hearts and transform them, so that in the end He becomes “all
    in all” (1 Corinthians 15:28).
</p>
<p>
    This is exactly what we would expect from a loving Father, and a loving
    Father is exactly whom God revealed Himself to be through Christ.
    Unconditional, self-sacrificial love that never gives up on any of His
    children, paired with corrective discipline that causes all of His children
    to develop into people of profound character. It does not get any better
    than that! Of course it doesn’t. Why should we expect anything less from
    the omnipotent, all-wise Creator of the universe, our Father in Heaven?
</p>
<h4>
    Salvation for All and Grace
</h4>
<p>
    Contrary to the brash claim that universal salvation distorts God’s grace,
    it actually is the <em>only</em> way that grace can truly be grace. To
    understand why, we must understand what grace is. According to
    <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/grace">
        Oxford’s online dictionary
    </a>
    , grace is “the free and unmerited favour of God.” In order to be free and
    unmerited, it must not be earned. Now, whether you claim that good deeds or
    belief in this life bring salvation—either way, you are earning it through
    merit. You have to do something, prior to death, to earn the right to
    experience grace. This, of course, is not actually free or unmerited, since
    you are obligated to perform some action in order to be saved. Right belief
    is still an action, or work that depends on you.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, the gift of salvation from sin and death is a true gift, bestowed
    upon all people. It was given while we were still sinners, prior to our
    repentance (Romans 5:8). It is not dependent on us <em>at all</em>, and is
    therefore true grace, unmerited and unconditional. This in no way discounts
    the importance of believing or receiving this gift by faith as Romans 3:25
    explains. We certainly cannot enjoy a free gift until we believe that it
    exists, and tear open the wrapping paper. But the gift still remains,
    whether we recognize it or not. God does not revoke this amazing gift at
    the moment of death, “for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable” (Romans
    11:29). He is not like a petulant child who throws a tantrum and takes back
a gift just because someone does not accept it right away. Such a view is<em> truly unworthy of God</em>. Such a view    <em>truly distorts God’s grace</em>. 
	Instead, God has unlimited time, unlimited love, and unlimited power to work 
	with. This is what it means to be God and for Him nothing is impossible to 
	accomplish, not even His desire for “all people to be saved and to come to 
	the knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2:4), even “the worst of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:16).
</p>
<p>
Christian universalism does not distort God’s grace, but this    <em>Desiring God </em>interview definitely distorts Christian universalism.
    But while we are on the topic of distortions of grace, let’s delve into a
    real one. John Piper, who founded the <em>Desiring God</em> website, is a
    devoted Calvinist and huge fan of the 18<sup>th</sup> century Puritan
    pastor Jonathan Edwards. After being encouraged to “choose one great
    theologian and apply myself throughout life to understanding and mastering
    his thought,” Piper chose Edwards. He goes so far as to say that “the
theologian I have devoted myself to is Jonathan Edwards” (Piper,    <em>A Personal Encounter with Jonathan Edwards</em>). The reason I bring
    this up is because Edwards’ theology is as awful a distortion of grace as
    can be imagined. Consider his own words:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“In hell God manifests his being and perfections only in hatred and wrath,
    and hatred without love” (Edwards 1738, <em>Charity and Its Fruits</em> p.
    390).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see the God who is love having none, but instead only hatred. The
    awfulness of this hatred is compounded by the fact that God has chosen to
    hate those in hell even before they were born. In Edward’s Calvinist
    theology, God has <em>only </em>ever loved the elect whom He chose before
    the world began. He has <em>always</em> hated those who he did not choose,
    and never loved them. This is not an exaggeration of Edwards’ theology.
    Consider his words again: 
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“The saints in glory will know concerning the
    damned in hell, that God <em>never</em> loved them, but that he hates them,
and [that they] will be for ever hated of God” (Edwards 1834,    <em>The End of the Wicked Contemplated by the Righteous</em>, section III).
	</blockquote>
<p>
According to Edwards, the saints “will rejoice in seeing the    <em>justice</em> of God glorified in the sufferings of the damned” because
    of the realization “that God has no love to them, nor pity for them; but
    that they are the objects of God’s eternal hatred.” (Ibid. section II).
</p>
<p>
    <em>That</em>
    is a distortion of God’s grace if there ever was one. To assert that God
    has <em>always</em> hated and <em>never</em> loved the vast majority of His
    children, indeed, that he <em>created</em> most people <em>expressly</em>
    to damn them to eternal suffering, is to slander God’s very character in
    the worst possible way.&nbsp;
    In Greek, the word for slander is
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/987.htm"><em>blasphémeó</em></a> (βλασφημέω), from which we
    get the word “blaspheme.”<strong> </strong> So, in essence, blasphemy is
    slander or speaking evil against God. I do not see how people can avoid
    seeing Edward’s claims as blasphemy, unless they have trained themselves to
    become people that “call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for
    light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
    bitter!” (Isaiah 5:20).
</p>
<p>
    The elitist view that God only loves some of us and hates the rest is an
    epic distortion of God’s grace. It portrays the God who is love as an
    immoral monster that decided to create countless human beings in order to
    condemn them to eternal suffering <em>on purpose</em>, for his supposed
    glory. No madman has ever done, or ever could do worse. No madman could
    even come close to unending torment for billions. Yet people who claim this
    worldview have the audacity to claim that the ultimate salvation of all
    people through self-sacrificial love, by the almighty God of the universe,
    is a distortion of grace! What utter, blathering nonsense!
</p>
<p>
    The fact is that God is willing and able to save everyone. He is not
    limited by anyone’s monstrous theology. His grace is truly a free gift for
    all people that cannot be earned. Through His amazing love and corrective
    discipline, He will transform us all to be like Him. It is a beautiful
    plan, executed by a beautiful God, whose love and mercy have no bounds.
