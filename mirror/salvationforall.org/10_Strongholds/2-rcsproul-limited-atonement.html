<h1>
    A Curious Argument for Limited Atonement by R. C. Sproul
</h1>
<p>
    Dr. R. C. Sproul was a well-known theologian, Presbyterian pastor, and
    prolific writer. We will now examine one of his arguments about limited
    atonement, the idea that Christ only atoned for some people.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		First, we ask if the atonement of Christ was a real atonement? Did Jesus
    really, or only potentially, satisfy the demands of God’s justice? If
    indeed Christ provided a propitiation and expiation for all human beings
    and for all their sins, then, clearly, all persons would be saved.
    Universal atonement, if it is actual, and not merely potential, means
    universal salvation. -R. C. Sproul
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that his first question is whether the atonement of Christ was real.
Answer this question for yourself. Was Christ’s atonement real? Did Jesus    <em>really</em>, or <em>only potentially</em>, satisfy the demands of God’s
    justice? Your answer to those questions determines the mandatory conclusion
    that you must arrive at, according to Dr. Sproul’s argument, so make sure
    you have an answer. Do you have one? If so, we can proceed in our analysis.
</p>
<p>
    You should note that if you believe that Jesus really died to atone for
    everyone (for the sins of the world), you are bound to believe in universal
salvation (i.e. that all will be saved), <em>according to</em>    <em>Sproul</em>. If Christ’s atonement was <em>real</em>, then universal
    salvation must <em>clearly</em> be true. That is unmistakably what he is
    saying.
</p>
<p>
    At first glance, it would seem this is an argument <em>for </em>universal
    salvation, but Sproul did not believe in universal salvation; he believed
    in the limited atonement of the Calvinist tradition. By implication, this
    indicates that he did not believe that Christ’s atonement was real or
    actual, but rather only <em>potential. </em>It is beyond strange that this
    is considered “orthodoxy.” It ignores multiple clear biblical statements,
    including the following:

    </strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 2:3-6
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		This is good, and pleases God our Savior,    <strong>who wants all people to be saved</strong> and to come to a
    knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God
and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as    <strong>a ransom for all people</strong>. This has now been witnessed to at
    the proper time.
	</blockquote>
<h3 align="center">
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A9&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        2 Peter 3:9
    </a>
    <u></u>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but
    is longsuffering toward us,
    <strong>
        not willing that any should perish but that all should come to
        repentance
    </strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    A careful reading of these texts leaves no real room for believing that God
    only intended to save some people through Jesus’ death and resurrection.
    Instead we see that Jesus is the Savior of the world and all people in it,
    and the atoning sacrifice who takes away the sins of the whole world as a
    ransom for all people. We also see that it is God's will that <em>all</em>
    come to repentance and that <em>none</em> should perish. How then can a
    belief in limited atonement be justified? Sproul’s approach is rather
    telling. He does <em>not</em> appeal to scripture. Instead, this is how he
    explains his view that limited atonement is a better view than universal
    salvation:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		However, the overwhelming majority of Christians who reject limited
    atonement also reject universal salvation. They are particularists, not
    universalists. They insist on the doctrine of justification by faith alone.
    That is, only believers are saved by the atonement of Christ.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		If that is so, then the atonement, in some sense, must be limited, or
    restricted, to a definite group, namely believers. If Christ died for all
    of the sins of all people, that must include the sin of unbelief. If God’s
    justice is totally satisfied by Christ’s work on the cross, then it would
    follow that God would be unjust in punishing the unrepentant sinner for his
    unbelief and impenitence because those sins were already paid for by
    Christ.-R.C. Sproul
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The rationale given here to reject universal salvation is that most
    Christians do not believe it, therefore limited atonement must be true. It
    must be pointed out that this reasoning is a blatant logical fallacy known
    as an <em>argumentum ad populum</em>, also known as a consensus fallacy,
    bandwagon fallacy, or appeal to the masses etc. The number of people that
    believe something has <em>no bearing whatsoever </em>on its truth. Most
    people used to believe that the world was flat, that the earth was the
    center of the universe, and that the sun orbited us. Most people used to be
    polytheists. Most people in the slave states of the South believed that the
    Bible condoned buying, selling, and brutally mistreating people based
    solely on their skin color. Most people believe any number of absurd
    falsehoods. In summary, what most people believe is utterly irrelevant to
    the truth of a claim.
</p>
<p>
    A cogent argument would look very different from the one being presented by
    Dr. Sproul. Let's see how this would look. As our first premise, we will
    use Sproul's very words:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Premise 1: "If indeed Christ provided a propitiation and expiation for all
    human beings and for all their sins, then, clearly, all persons would be
    saved. Universal atonement, if it is actual, and not merely potential,
    means universal salvation."
		- R.C. Sproul</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Premise 2: 1 John 2:2 clearly states that Christ "is the    <strong>atoning sacrifice</strong> (propitiation) for our sins, and
    <strong>
        not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."
    </strong>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		
        Conclusion: Universal salvation must be true because Jesus really is
        the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world as stated by the
        Scriptures.
    
    </blockquote>
<p>
        Now, <em>that</em> is a logical, coherent argument. To deny the
        conclusion is to deny one or both of the premises. So, we
        have two options if we want to believe in limited atonement:
    </p>
	<blockquote>
		1. 
        We can deny Sproul's premise that universal atonement means universal
        salvation, in which case his entire argument for limited atonement
        crumbles (since it is based on this premise).
    </blockquote>
<p>
    Or<strong> </strong>
</p>
	<blockquote>
		2. 
We can deny the truth of 1 John 2:2 and say that Christ is        <em>not really</em> the propitiation “for the sins of the whole world.”
    </blockquote>
<p>
        We <em>cannot </em>logically maintain that both are true and accept the
        doctrine of limited atonement. This is why Dr. Sproul does not appeal
        to Scripture but instead utilizes the bandwagon fallacy: there is no
        scripture that contradicts 1 John 2:2. The solution is to simply ignore
        it and appeal to the masses who do not believe in universal salvation.
        But this reasoning is utterly fallacious and has no scriptural backing.
        Remember, the question that we are asking here is what the Bible says
        about atonement. Ignoring the biblical text in favor of an
    <em>argumentum ad populum</em>
    is obviously not helpful in answering this question.
</p>
<p>
    One other issue with Dr. Sproul's argument relates to his understanding of
    punishment. Let's revisit his words briefly:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		If God’s justice is totally satisfied by Christ’s work on the cross, then
    it would follow that God would be unjust in punishing the unrepentant
    sinner for his unbelief and impenitence because those sins were already
    paid for by Christ.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this sentence, Sproul is claiming that God would not be able to justly
    punish sins if Christ truly atoned for these sins. This reasoning is only
    true, however, if the rationale for punishment is purely retributive and
    understood as a form of atoning for one's own sins. But what if God
    punishes as a Father for the purpose of correction and training in
    righteousness? This is, after all, why good parents punish their children:
    to correct and train them. I do not give my son a consequence solely to
    satisfy my desire for justice, but rather to inspire his growth and
    learning. If God behaves as a Father (which is how He is frequently
    described in the Scriptures), He could also punish as a means to correct.
    In fact, the Scriptures tell us that even believers experience corrective
    discipline and that "judgment must begin at the house of God" (1 Peter
    4:17). Are we to believe that this means that Christ did not atone for
    believers in the house of God since we too experience judgment?
</p>
<p>
    Clearly not. Instead, we see that "the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
    and chastises every son whom he receives" (Hebrews 12:6). This discipline
    can be painful. The Scriptures tell us as much: “No discipline seems
    pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest
    of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it” (Hebrews
    12:11). So, we see that punishment (described here as painful discipline)
    is something that is experienced also by believers. God will judge fairly
    “for God does not show favoritism” (Romans 2:11). Therefore, if believers
    do wrong, they will still experience discipline, according to the Bible. In
    fact, in Romans 2 Paul is warning <em>believers</em> not to judge because
    in doing so they were “storing up wrath against [themselves] for the day of
    God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed” (Romans 2:5).
    Does this mean that Christ did not actually pay for the sins of these
    believers?
</p>
<p>
    Of course not, and that is the point: God’s chastening punishment (and even
    his wrath) can still occur even though atonement has happened for everyone.
    Sproul’s argument implies that God would be unable to judge the world if
    consequences for sin are experienced by those Christ died for. But we know
    from the Scriptures that God can and does judge and chastise those that
    Christ died for. It is, in fact, a hallmark of being His child. So,
    although Dr. Sproul’s argument is intended to suggest that universal
    salvation conflicts with the clear Scriptural teaching that God will judge,
    it can be seen quite clearly that there is, in fact, no real conflict
    between the ultimate salvation of all people and God’s righteous, refining
    judgment. Instead, we see judgment and discipline are part of the process
    through which sanctification occurs.
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
    R.C. Sproul’s argument for limited atonement is not a logical, coherent
    argument. Instead, combining his foundational premises with Scripture
    actually <em>refutes</em> the claim he is trying to prove, and provides a
    powerful argument for the ultimate salvation of all people. Christ’s
    atonement for all people is clearly attested to by many Scriptures. God’s
    righteous judgment and punishment of sin does not negate the power or scope
    of this atonement to save every person. And no amount of bandwagon fallacy
    can change that.
