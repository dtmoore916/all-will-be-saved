<h1>
    Dehumanization
</h1>
<p>
    A fundamental, hallmark tactic for justifying atrocities is to dehumanize
    the victims. Nazi propaganda referred to Jews as <em>Untermenschen</em>
    (subhumans) and as rats. Hutus involved in the Rwanda genocide called
    Tutsis cockroaches. Slave owners considered slaves to be subhuman chattel
    <a
        href="https://d.docs.live.net/6da06aedd93422fe/salvation%20for%20all%20stuff/(https:/www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134956180/criminals-see-their-victims-as-less-than-human)."
    >
        (Smith 2011).
    </a>
    During colonial periods, native populations were frequently referred to as
    “savages” and exploited accordingly. The “untouchables” of the Hindu caste
    system have experienced a similar fate. To this day, racial slurs are a
    staple of racist bigotry. We could go on and on. Such conceptualizations
    are intended to dehumanize people and are necessary in order to wrongly
    defend evil actions against them. When the victim is subhuman, when all
    intrinsic value is stripped from them and they are fully vilified, anything
    goes—torture, murder, rape, exploitation, merciless hatred,
    genocide—anything.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, this tactic of dehumanization is center stage in
    attempting to justify the doctrine of eternal conscious torment.
</p>
<p>
    Consider, for example, the following portrait of the little old lady down
the street by Greg Morse (a staff writer for the website    <em>Desiring God</em>):
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The first consideration is clarifying what sort of creature will be under
    God’s wrath forever. The little old lady who has shown herself to be a
    selfless, gentle, patient, forgiving, and amiable neighbor may have a
    quaint funeral. But the person eulogized is not the person who she truly
    was nor who she will show herself to be in eternity to come. God has hidden
    her from us. At death, God repossesses all borrowed virtue, the full
    torrent of her wicked heart is unleashed. She will be fully given over to
    her sin (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%201.24" target="_blank">Romans 1:24
    </a>
,    <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%201.26" target="_blank">26</a>
,    <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%201.28" target="_blank">28</a>).
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		The hatred of God, the impatience, the lustful thoughts, the greed, the
    slander, the viciousness, all will stampede forth. The evil that showed
    itself in seed form on earth will grow to be forests. The light of common
    grace will fade from her, and she will be given to the darkness which she
    so loved 
    <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.19" target="_blank">
        (John 3:19).
    </a>
    &nbsp;Her full depravity, now exposed, will cause the saints who cared most
    for her on earth to shudder. Sin, fully enthroned, dehumanizes.
    <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/what-does-hell-say-about-god">
(“What Does Hell Say About God? The Truth Many Cannot Bear to Hear.”)</a></blockquote>
<p>
    There are several notable tactics of dehumanization utilized in this piece.
    Notice that he begins by discussing “what sort of <em>creature</em>” will
    be tormented, implying a subhuman, nonpersonal creature that is
    astonishingly evil. The “full depravity” of this wicked <em>creature</em>
    will cause the saints who cared for her to “shudder” in horror. The
    “selfless, gentle, patient, forgiving and amiable” little old lady, who
    clearly exhibits multiple fruits of the Spirit during her lifetime (see
    Galatians 5:22-23) is not only dehumanized, but also <em>demonized</em>.
    Though we experienced her as selfless and kind and forgiving, this is a
    God-generated illusion and is “not who she truly was” for “God has hidden
    her from us.” Her true nature, says the author (who cunningly attempts to
    invalidate any <em>experiential</em> knowledge of the <em>actual</em>
    person), is unadulterated wickedness. She is portrayed as if she were a
    vile demon, an ork, a goblin, a creature so repulsive and disgusting that
    any punishment could be justified. That <em>thing</em> deserves what it
    gets. Such is the author’s tactic—straight out of Joseph Goebbel’s
    propagandist playbook. He even admits to it in his concluding sentence—his
    picture of the kind old woman “dehumanizes” her.
</p>
<p>
Besides the fact that such a characterization of this gentle woman should    <em>intuitively</em> strike us as disingenuous and contrary to experience,
    is the fact that it is wholly unscriptural. The author asserts that “at
    death, God repossesses all borrowed virtue, the full torrent of her wicked
    heart is unleashed” and that she will become pure, unbridled evil. Where
    does this idea come from? Although the author purports to support his claim
    with the Bible by citing verse numbers, a closer examination reveals that
    he is not interpreting the texts (also known as exegesis) but reading false
    doctrine into them (also known as eisegesis). To see why, we will carefully
    examine the texts that he uses as alleged support for his claim. Here they
    are:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 1:24, 26, 28 (I also included 1:25 and 1:27 that the author omitted)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore God <strong>gave</strong> them over in the sinful desires of
    their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one
another. They <strong>exchanged</strong> the truth about God for a lie, and    <strong>worshiped</strong> and <strong>served</strong> created things
    rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Because of this, God <strong>gave</strong> them over to shameful lusts.
    Even their women <strong>exchanged</strong> natural sexual relations for
    unnatural ones. In the same way the men also <strong>abandoned</strong>
    natural relations with women and <strong>were inflamed</strong> with lust
    for one another. Men <strong>committed</strong> shameful acts with other
    men, and <strong>received</strong> in themselves the due penalty for their
    error.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Furthermore, just as they <strong>did not think</strong> it worthwhile to
    retain the knowledge of God, so God <strong>gave</strong> them over to a
    depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    John 3:19
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people<strong> loved</strong> darkness instead of light because their deeds    <strong>were</strong> evil.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    I used bold font for most of the verbs in the passages above to illustrate
    a simple point. What do you notice about the tense of these verbs?
</p>
<p>
Astute readers should pick up on the fact that they are all    <em>past tense</em> verbs. In short, these are things that have already
    happened. Paul and John are describing the historical realities of what
    human beings and societies have <em>already</em> done, and the penalties
    they have <em>already </em>received. Can these verses be honestly used to
    support the claim that our little old lady will become a demonic creature
    at the point of death? Are these verses discussing a post-mortem state at
    all? Are they about hell? Of course not. It is contextually clear that
    those ideas are being read <em>into</em> the text, not read <em>out</em> of
    it.
</p>
<p>
    The point of these verses is to explain the state of humanity historically
    (and perhaps implicitly presently) as being sinful and choosing wrong
    actions. I think we are all aware of this, but it certainly should not
    dehumanize everyone such that we shudder in horror at the sight of them. In
    fact, the Romans 1 passage is part of a larger rhetorical strategy meant to
    show those who are judging “sinners” that they too are in the same boat and
have no right to be judgmental. Consider Romans 2:1, which    <em>immediately</em> and <em>abruptly</em> follows the conclusion of Paul’s
    clever and purposeful rant about the wickedness of “them.”
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 2:1-4
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>You</strong>, therefore, have no excuse, <strong>you</strong> who pass judgment on
someone else, for at whatever point <strong>you</strong> judge another,<strong> you</strong> are condemning <strong>yourself</strong>, because    <strong>you</strong> who pass judgment do the same things. Now we know that
God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. So when    <strong>you</strong>, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do
    the same things, do <strong>you</strong> think you will escape God’s
    judgment? Or do <strong>you</strong> show contempt for the riches of his
    kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is
    intended to lead <strong>you</strong> to repentance?
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Paul makes it clear to the self-righteous (who were judging “those sinners
    over there”) that they <em>are</em> those sinners. The pride and judgment
    that had been swelling in their hearts is abruptly crushed by the reality
    that Paul was not condemning <em>other </em>sinners as it appeared, but
    rather clarifying that all are sinners and that judging others shows
    contempt for God’s kindness and stores up God’s wrath against the
    judgmental (Romans 2:5). He also makes it clear that “at whatever point you
    judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment
    do the same things.” With this in mind, consider Morse’s judgment of the
    patient, selfless, kind old woman (aka the demon spawn creature), whose
    horrifying nature was hidden from us via divine subterfuge. He lists her
    abominable sins: “the hatred of God, the impatience, the lustful thoughts,
    the greed, the slander, the viciousness.” Perhaps all of those sins are
    completely foreign to him. Maybe he has never been impatient, or had
    lustful thoughts, or greedily desired more than he had. Perhaps he has
    never been against God or been vicious or slandered anyone (except of
    course the little old lady of his tale). Or perhaps by judging others so
    harshly he is showing contempt for the riches of God’s kindness,
    forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to
    lead <em>him</em> and <em>all of us</em> to repentance, not self-righteous,
    dehumanizing judgmentalism toward others who have our very same
    shortcomings and struggles.

    It is clear that <em>all of us</em> are, at some point, slaves to sin, and
    that God has given us over to depraved thoughts and actions. Such a state
    is never described as permanent, nor is there any evidence that the
    passages cited above are describing a post-mortem state in which all
    goodness is removed from people, such that they become unrecognizably vile
    creatures. In fact, the opposite is true. We find God, in Scripture,
    redeeming those whom he temporarily allowed to follow their evil desires.
    In 1 Corinthians 6, for example, after listing an assortment of sins that
    are strikingly similar to those found in Romans 1, Paul says the following:
</p>
<h3>
    1 Corinthians 6:11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And such <strong>were</strong> some of you. But you were washed, you were
    sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by
    the Spirit of our God.
	</blockquote>
<p>
It is clear that being given over to our sinful thoughts and desires    <em>permanently in hell</em> is not in view at all. The believers Paul is
    writing to once <em>were</em> slaves to sin but now have been washed,
    sanctified and justified in Christ and by the Holy Spirit. Thus, being
    given over to sin is <em>explicitly</em> temporary, a past tense state that
    is overcome. In fact, in the book of Romans itself, it is clear that the
    reason God allowed people to follow their own dark paths was so that He
    could show us all mercy, “for God has consigned all to disobedience, that
    he may have mercy on all” (Romans 11:32).
</p>
<p>
    So, in reality, <em>none</em> of the verses cited by Morse as supposed
evidence that all goodness is stripped from people at the point of death    <em>actually</em> support such a claim. The question may be asked, “why not
    cite some verses that do support his claim?” The answer is simple and
    telling: no such verses exist. The demonizing dehumanization he describes
    only exists in his imagination, a failed theodicy for a false doctrine that
    should not be defended in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    We cannot blame him too much though. It seems to me that the primary reason
    for creating this myth is that his conscience is still functional and
    rightly acknowledges that condemning an actual person (as they really are)
    to such a horrific state as endless torment is morally unacceptable and
    unjust. So, dehumanization is the <em>only</em> way, in his mind, to retain
    his hell doctrine without slandering the character of God and maligning Him
    as unjust and cruel. <em>Those</em> people <em>have to be</em> monsters,
    valueless creatures, soulless orks. Otherwise, tormenting kind little old
ladies forever is just wrong, and he knows it. Dehumanization is the    <em>only</em> solution to this quandary.
</p>
<p>
    Like others who defend endless hell, he is backed into a corner and must
    search for some way to bypass the moral implications of this belief. Since
    he takes the doctrine of endless hell as a fundamental non-negotiable
    reality, he believes that he is defending truth, and this is simply the
    best defense he could muster. The fact that it relies exclusively on
    dehumanizing myths and not on Scripture, however, should give us pause.
    Actually, the fact that it uses dehumanization <em>at all</em>, that it
    uses the same tactic as Nazi propagandists, genocidal killers, and brutal
    abusers who are intent on justifying atrocities, should be very disturbing
    to anyone attempting to follow Jesus’ commands to love.
</p>
<h4>
    Dehumanizes those who believe it
</h4>
<p>
    Not only does the doctrine of endless hell dehumanize those who are assumed
    to be going there, but also those who cling to the doctrine. To see why, we
    will examine some primary sources. The first is from a sermon by Charles
    Spurgeon, entitled <em>Heaven and Hell</em>.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		That was a dreadful dream which a pious mother once had, and told to her
    children. She thought the judgment day was come. The great books were
    opened. They all stood before God. And Jesus Christ said, "Separate the
    chaff from the wheat; put the goats on the left hand, and the sheep on the
    right. The mother dreamed that she and her children were standing just in
    the middle of the great assembly. And the angel came, and said, "I must
    take the mother, she is a sheep: she must go to the right hand. The
    children are goats: they must go on the left." She thought as she went, her
    children clutched her, and said, "Mother, can we part? Must we be
    separated?" She then put her arms around them, and seemed to say, "My
    children, I would, if possible, take you with me." But in a moment the
    angel touched her; her cheeks were dried, and now,
    <strong>
        overcoming natural affection, being rendered supernatural and sublime
    </strong>
    , resigned to God's will, she said, "My children, I taught you well, I
trained you up, and you forsook the ways of God; and    <strong>now all I have to say is, Amen to your condemnation</strong>."
Thereupon they were snatched away, and    <strong>she saw them in perpetual torment while she was in heaven</strong>.
    Young man, what will you think, when the last day comes, to hear Christ
    say, "Depart, ye cursed?" And there will be a voice just behind him,
    saying, Amen. And, as you inquire whence came the voice, you will find it
    was your mother. Or, young woman, when thou art cast away into utter
    darkness, what will you think to hear a voice saying, Amen. And as you
    look, there sits your father, his lips still moving with the solemn curse.

    </a>
    )
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is fascinating that Spurgeon equates “being rendered supernatural and
    sublime” with “overcoming natural affection.” So, in his view, it is
    supernatural strength that enables a mother to no longer love or care for
    her own children! While I agree that such a lack of love might indeed be
    supernatural, I do not agree with Spurgeon as to the source of such
    supernatural power. Being heartlessly callous and unloving toward one’s own
    children, such that a mother is able to look down on her own children in
    “perpetual torment” while she blissfully experiences heaven’s joys, is
    supernaturally dark and evil, not light and good. Notice that the mother is
    actually watching her children in hell (a literal fire of constant torture
    <a
        href="3-slick-carm-literalism.html"
    >
        according to Spurgeon
    </a>
    ), and is completely unaffected. Notice the robotic condemnations of
    parents of their children, cursing them to such a fate without the
    slightest shred of love toward their own. Is this really the gospel—that we
    will get to heaven and become uncaring soulless

    >
        psychopaths
    </a>
    ? Lest someone think such a term is too harsh, it is the very definition of
    a psychopath to have no empathy for others and no qualms of conscience
    about that lack of empathy.
</p>
<p>
But many writers have gone further still, claiming that Christians will    <em>greatly enjoy</em> watching the sufferings of the damned. Consider the
    following quotes from defenders of eternal hell from several time periods:
</p>
<h3>
    Tertullian (2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Century North African
    Theologian)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		How vast a spectacle then bursts upon the eye! What there    <strong>excites my admiration</strong>? what <strong>my derision</strong>?
Which sight <strong>gives me joy</strong>? which rouses me to    <strong>exultation</strong>?--as I see so many illustrious monarchs, whose
    reception into the heavens was publicly announced, groaning now in the
    lowest darkness with great Jove himself, and those, too, who bore witness
    of their exultation; governors of provinces, too, who persecuted the
    Christian name, in fires more fierce than those with which in the days of
    their pride they raged against the followers of Christ. <a name="30_4"></a>
    What world's wise men besides, the very philosophers, in fact, who taught
    their followers that God had no concern in ought that is sublunary, and
    were wont to assure them that either they had no souls, or that they would
    never return to the bodies which at death they had left, now covered with
    shame before the poor deluded ones, as one fire consumes them! Poets also,
    trembling not before the judgment-seat of Rhadamanthus or Minos, but of the
    unexpected Christ!<a name="30_5"></a> I shall have a better opportunity
    then of hearing the tragedians, louder-voiced in their own calamity; of
    viewing the play-actors, much more "dissolute" in the dissolving flame; of
    looking upon the charioteer, all glowing in his chariot of fire; of
    beholding the wrestlers, not in their gymnasia, but tossing in the fiery
    billows; unless even then I shall not care to attend to such ministers of
    sin, in <strong>my eager wish rather to fix a gaze insatiable</strong> on
    those whose fury vented itself against the Lord.
    <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-09.htm#P1011_411386">
        (<em>De Spectaculis</em>, Chapter XXX)
    </a>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice Tertullian’s sadistic joy, admiration, and exultation about the idea
    of watching the pain of others. Notice his insatiable lust for revenge. He
    just can't ever get enough. He will never be satisfied, fixing his
    “insatiable gaze" forevermore on the supposed enemies of Jesus. Contrast
    this with Jesus' own response toward those who crucified Him: “Father,
    forgive them; for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34). It doesn't take
    a PhD to see that the mind of Christ and the mind of Tertullian are
    completely different here.
</p>
<p>
    Although Tertullian is certainly not representative of the thinking of the
    early church, his vindictive, cruel mindset dominated in the middle ages
    when Greek learning was lost to the Western Church, and unfortunately
    persists even today. Here are just a few examples:

We could continue to examine sadistic, merciless statements of this type    <em>ad nauseum </em>(although we perhaps have already reached that point—of
    generating nausea, that is). But I think we have seen enough for now. The
    idea that saints will enjoy the suffering of others in hell, that it will
    bring us unspeakably delightful pleasure to watch their pain, that we
    should savor their agony like the most decadent chocolate (“a passing
    delectation”), should sound absolutely outrageous. Are we really to believe
    that the end result of the Christian life in which we strive to love others
    (even our enemies as Christ commanded) is to become sadistic psychopaths in
    heaven—not only uncaring but <em>delighting</em> in the torment of others?
    Does that sound even a little bit reasonable?

    Apparently, to some people it does. Although, I must say, it seems
    necessary to beat such thinking into them forcefully and against their
    better judgment. For example, consider the story of how R.C. Sproul became
    indoctrinated into believing a doctrine that he found “ridiculous.” Around
minute 19 of video sermon, entitled    <em>Can We Enjoy Heaven Knowing of Loved Ones in Hell?</em>, Sproul
    recounts angering his mentor John Gerstner during a seminar class in which
    a student asked:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Dr. Gerstner, how can I be happy in heaven if I am aware that one of my
    loved ones is in hell?”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		And Gerstner snapped around and looked at this man and he said
    [aggressively and intimidatingly, it seems to me], “Don’t you know that
    when you are in heaven, you will be so sanctified that you will be able to
    see your own mother in hell and rejoice in that, knowing that God’s perfect
    justice is being carried out?
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		And while the student who asked that question shrunk back in horror, his
    face turning white, I burst out laughing. And he looked at me, he says:
    “What’s so funny?” I said, “excuse me Dr. Gerstner,” I said, “I can’t
    believe you said what you just said. Nobody talks like that.” And I’m
    thinking, this guy’s nuts… that I’ll be so sanctified in heaven that I
    could look into the pit of hell and see my mother there and be glad. I
    can’t imagine anything more ridiculous than that. But he got my attention.
    I had to think about it, deeply and often.
    <a href="https://youtu.be/D00_sM-rTCQ">
        (Sproul, Can We Enjoy Heaven Knowing of Loved Ones in Hell? 2013)
    </a>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It seems that young Sproul had good instincts. He recognized the absurdity
    of Gerstner’s claim and couldn’t “imagine anything more ridiculous” than
    rejoicing about watching his mother burn in hell. But being mentored by
    Gerstner and force-fed a steady diet of this theology gradually took its
    toll—he becomes the very guy that he thought was “nuts.” It is noteworthy,
    however, that this shift in thinking only comes about as a result of him
    continually kicking against the goads of his conscience. Around minute 42
    of this same video, Sproul says the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"…if it means that my friends, if it means my family must be sacrificed for
    the righteousness of God, for the manifestation of his holiness, for the
    glory of his righteousness, though I can't <em>stomach</em> the thought of
    it now, this word tells me that the day will come where I will be so
    concerned about the glory of God and of Jesus that I will be able to
    rejoice in his judgment. We're not there yet folks, but that is our
    destiny.”
    <a href="https://youtu.be/D00_sM-rTCQ">
        (Sproul, Can We Enjoy Heaven Knowing of Loved Ones in Hell? 2013)
    </a>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that he can’t stomach the sickening thought of sacrificing his
    family and friends to the flames of everlasting hell to appease a wrathful
    deity. Perhaps there is a reason for his continued disgust about his own
    views, despite his best efforts to force himself to believe them. The
    imagery he uses should sound familiar. It is said that in the worship of
    Molech parents would place their infant children onto the red-hot hands of
    the idol to burn them alive as a sacrifice to appease this angry god. All
    the while, musicians would loudly beat drums to drown out the tortured
    shrieks of pain of these children. They would beat the drums not only to
    silence the cries of anguish but also the pangs of conscience. I would
    submit to you that the reason for Sproul’s revulsion was that he had a
    conscience—that the still small voice of the Holy Spirit was still working
    against the cacophonus bluster of an incoherent religious tradition that
    bears more similarities to the worship of Molech than to the God of love
    revealed by Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Despite spending a lifetime working so hard to dehumanize himself and
    divorce his theology from his conscience, Sproul admits that he has not
    been successful: “We're not there yet folks, but that is our destiny.” I
    cannot help but be reminded of Darth Vader’s attempt to persuade Luke
    Skywalker to come over to the dark side. “It is your destiny,” he urged, in
    his deep, gravelly voice. Fortunately, Luke resisted a dark destiny and we
    should as well, especially since we have no biblical warrant for believing
    that the destiny of the Christian life could possibly be sadism. Such a
    destiny is diametrically opposed to the compassionate character traits we
    are trying to develop in this life. How could the end result of following
    Christ, the very model of self-sacrificial love, forgiveness, and
    compassion, be a complete lack of all these traits?
</p>
<p>
    So, I refuse to beat the drums.
</p>
<p>
    The arguments for doing so are unbiblical and incoherent. Consider the
    following (also from the same video):
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Until our glorification, our concerns and our sympathies rest much more
    with wicked human beings than they do for the glory of God and for the
    exaltation of Christ, and what Gerstner was trying to communicate to me
    that day in the classroom, which I thought was so absurd, was that once sin
    is removed from my life and once I get to that state where I love the Lord
    my God with all of my heart and all of my soul in undiluted affection, my
    compassion, my love, my concern will be much more for the vindication of
    God's holiness than it will be for a corrupt fallen kinsman of mine
    according to the flesh... that's so hard to imagine because what is so hard
    for you to imagine and so hard for me to imagine is to be free of sin. You
    know, I hate the doctrine of hell, in many ways. I can't stand the thought
    of anybody being in hell, even Hitler, because I am so Hitler-esque…"
    	<a href="https://youtu.be/D00_sM-rTCQ">(Sproul, Can We Enjoy Heaven Knowing of Loved Ones in Hell? 2013,

    </a>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Does caring for other people remind you of Hitler? Me neither.
</p>
<p>
    Affection, compassion, love, and concern for others are not Hitler-esque
    traits; delighting in their suffering is. That Sproul hates the doctrine of
    hell and that he “can’t stand the thought of anybody being in hell” are due
    to his compassion toward fellow human beings, a Christ-like characteristic,
    not a Hitler-esque characteristic. This should be glaringly obvious.
</p>
<p>
    But besides the incoherency of his last statement is the fact that loving
    God is inseparable from loving other people. As Jesus said in Matthew
    22:37-40 (NKJV):</p>
	<blockquote>
		“‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul,
    and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment.
    <strong>
        And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
    </strong>
    On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
We do <em>not</em> love God more by loving people less. The    <em>exact opposite </em>is true. The second commandment is <em>like</em>
    the first. They are tied together such that people cannot love God with all
    of their hearts, souls, and minds unless they love others as well. The
    apostle John stated this truth as follows:
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 4:7-21 NKJV
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who
    loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God,
    for God is love. In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God
    has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
    Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent
His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved,    <strong>if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</strong> No
    one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and
    His love has been perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in Him,
    and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. And we have seen and
testify that the Father has sent the Son as    <strong>Savior of the world</strong>. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the
    Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. And we have known and
    believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in
    love abides in God, and God in him. Love has been perfected among us in
    this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is,
    so are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts
    out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made
    perfect in love. We love Him because He first loved us.
    <strong>
        If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for
        he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God
        whom he has not seen? And this commandment we have from Him: that he
        who loves God must love his brother also.
    </strong>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The love of other people is <em>inseparable</em> from the love of God. In
    fact, John states that someone who claims to love God but does not love
    others is a liar! You simply <em>cannot</em> love God without loving other
    people. How does this biblical thinking compare to the ideas expressed
    above that we will take pleasure in watching our children, our brothers,
    our sisters, our parents, and many others burning forever in eternal
    conscious torment? Do we love our brother while we mercilessly rejoice in
    his unending suffering? And if we do not love our brothers and others whom
    we have seen, how can we love God whom we have not? John’s answer is
    simple: we can’t. The doctrine of endless torment is dehumanizing to
    believers because it attempts to force us to accept a destiny in which we
    will become inhumane, cruel, and unloving toward others.
</p>
<h4>
    Human Dignity
</h4>
<p>
    In contrast to the dehumanizing rhetoric of endless hell proponents, we
    find a biblical picture that gives great dignity to human beings. The Bible
    repeatedly teaches that people are made in the image and likeness of God
    (Genesis 1:26-31, Genesis 5:1-2, Genesis 9:6, James 3:9, 1 Corinthians
    11:7). In fact, it is only after the creation of people in Genesis 1 that
    God declares that what He had made was <em>very</em> good. Before the
    creation of humans, things were good but not yet <em>very</em> good. We are
    the crown and climax of God’s work, made in His image and likeness.
</p>
<p>
    Consider Psalm 8:4-5 (NKJV):
</p>
	<blockquote>
		What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit
    him? For You have made him a little lower than the angels, And You have
    crowned him with glory and honor.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that the psalmist describes people as just slightly lower than
    angels and as crowned with glory and honor. This concept is repeated in
    Hebrews 2:7 (where the Psalm is quoted), showing that this understanding of
    humanity is consistent in both the New and Old Testaments. We are not
    worthless, despicable creatures as many have argued in an attempt to
    justify the doctrine of hell.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, we are precious to God, His most intricate handiwork:
</p>
<h3>
    Psalms 139:13-15 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. I will
    praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your
    works, And that my soul knows very well. My frame was not hidden from You,
    When I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of
    the earth.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice the skill and care with which God makes people. Are we to suppose
    that God fearfully and wonderfully makes people but then tosses these same
    people, like worthless trash, into endless hell for not understanding the
    gospel in their short lifetimes? Life is confusing, with competing
    philosophies and pressures, unclear information, and heartbreaking
    suffering. Add to this the glaring hypocrisy of some who claim the name of
    Christ and yet commit or defend atrocities. Is it any wonder that people
    are not always sure of the gospel? Will God really see a kind, selfless
    woman who doubted as subhuman garbage and torture her for all of eternity?
    Or does He love the works of His hands and continue to pursue her as His
    beloved child?
</p>
<h4>
    We Are All God’s Children
</h4>
<p>
    It is noteworthy that the Bible clearly makes the connection between God
    creating us, skillfully weaving us together in our mother’s wombs, and
    being our good Father.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2%3A10&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Malachi 2:10
    </a>
    &nbsp;(ESV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?</strong>
    Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our
    fathers?
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that Malachi is speaking of faithless, profane people but claiming
    God’s fatherhood over such people, even those who are not walking in His
    ways. Even if we are faithless, he is still our Father, for He is the
    Father of all of humanity.
</p>
<h3>
    Acts 17:26-29
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole
    earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the
    boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and
perhaps reach out for him and find him, though<strong> he is not far from any one of us.</strong>    <strong> ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ </strong>As some
    of your own poets have said, ‘<strong>We are his offspring</strong>.’
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore since <strong>we are God’s offspring</strong>, we should not
    think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made
    by human design and skill.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In context, Paul is addressing a crown of pagan Athenians. Notice that he
    confirms that <em>we</em> are his offspring, including himself and all of
    the Athenians as God’s children in whom “<em>we</em> live and move and have
    our being.” He expresses the solidarity of all mankind as God’s children,
    even if we have strayed and do not believe the truth. Remember, the crowd
    was not Christian. It was not Jewish. He was speaking to idol-worshipping
    Greeks who had never heard the gospel and confirming that they too are
    God’s offspring and that He is not far from anyone.
</p>
<p>
    He makes a similar claim in Ephesians 4:6, stating that there is “one God
    and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” In like
    manner, 1 Corinthians 8:6 states that “there is one God, the Father, from
    whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ,
    through whom are all things and through whom we exist.” Notice that God is
    the Father of all and that all come from Him. It is important, however, to
    notice that He is not an absentee Father who creates us and then abandons
    us, but rather that He is also “over all and through all and in all.” This
    confirms Paul’s assertion that the Father is “not far from any one of us.”
    Instead, He is working in and through everyone, not giving up on any lost
    child but rather seeking each one until He finds him or her.
</p>
<p>
    This universal Fatherhood of God is why Jesus was able to teach the
    non-Christian crowds in Matthew 6 to pray to “our Father in heaven.”
    Remember, there was no such thing as Christianity when He taught this
    prayer. Not even His disciples knew who He was. So, although the crowds
    were listening to Him, they certainly had no concept that He was their Lord
    and Savior. How many of them later shouted “crucify Him,” we will never
    know. Yet, He teaches all of us to pray to our Father, the loving, good
    Father of all.
</p>
<p>
    All of us are God’s offspring, His dearly loved children. Is it even
    possible for a good Father to abandon even one of His children to endless
    misery and then ask His other children to rejoice in their unceasing
    torture? I think not. Instead of dehumanizing other children of God, we
should “honor all people,” as    <a href="https://bible.com/bible/114/1pe.2.17.NKJV">1 Peter 2:17</a>
    teaches, because God has made us in His image and likeness, clothed us in
    honor and glory, and called us His children (even when we have strayed).
</p>
<h4>
    How Did We Get Here?
</h4>
<p>
    Considering the contrast between the biblical picture of humanity and the
    dehumanizing statements of those who are defending eternal conscious
    torment seems to raise the question of how we got so far from truth. I
    think one of the key reasons is that the traditions of men die hard. They
    are passed on in ignorance from one generation to the next and accepted
    uncritically, no matter how absurd. This is especially the case if the
    tradition is enforced with threats of earthly death and torture, plus
    eternal damnation, as has historically been the case with the doctrine of
    hell. But the tradition of eternal torment is not actually Christian at
    all; instead, it was appropriated from surrounding cultures who already had
    these types of myths. Unfortunately, many Christians are still captivated
    by the oppressive, ignorant traditions of the Dark ages. Consider the
    following 12<sup>th</sup> century painting by the Alsatian nun and abbess,
    Herrad of Landsberg:

</p>
<p>
    Pretty disturbing stuff. We might as well admit that if a child drew
    something similar, he or she would be referred to psychological counseling,
    because something's clearly wrong with that kid. Yet, here we have a
    Christian leader (the head of the rest of the nuns in her abbey), painting
    this sick-minded junk. And she is not even close to alone in such perverse
    imaginings—similar nonsense pervades medieval art and literature, and
    persists in popular imagination even still.
</p>
<p>
    At any rate, there is much that could be said about the painting, but there
    is one detail that is really striking and worth pointing out. Look at the
    faces of Satan and the demons. What do you notice?
</p>
<p>
    Did you see that they are smiling, having a grand time inflicting horrific
    tortures on people? They are all <em>happy</em> in hell.
</p>
<p>
    And <em>they</em> are in control.
</p>
<p>
    Why do I bring this up? Well, it seems that in the Bible one of the key
    desires of demons and Satan is to control people and to be worshipped. When
    Satan tried to tempt Jesus, he tried to influence him to worship and
    glorify him, and when demons possessed people, they controlled them.
    Spiritual darkness loves domineering power. With this in mind, who might be
    behind a doctrine that gives the forces of spiritual darkness unquestioned
    dominance over human beings created in God’s image? I think Paul gives us
    the answer:
</p>
	<h3>1 Timothy 4:1-2 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from
    the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,
    speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot
    iron…
	</blockquote>
<p>
    I want to pause now and consider one specific characteristic Paul mentions
    in those who are giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons:
    a seared conscience. This means that the conscience is no longer
    functioning properly, having been numbed through cauterization such that it
    is unable to feel and discern right and wrong. Now, consider the
    dehumanization and demonization of poor, old Gladys to defend her endless
    torture. Ponder the stoic, unfeeling parental damnations of their children
    to being burnt alive for all of eternity. Think on the expressions of utter
    delight and joy expressed by theologians who are eagerly anticipating
    gazing on the excruciating sufferings of others with no pity or compassion
    for them. Contemplate the repeated citing of Bible verse numbers that, upon
    further inspection, do not say what the authors are forcefully claiming.
</p>
<p>
    Consider also the hypocrisy of mercilessly condemning others for the very
    sins that we too commit and the dishonesty of representing others as
    subhuman creatures. For either God or Greg Morse must be deceiving us as to
    the nature of old Gladys—God, by hiding her true nature from us as Morse
    claims, or Morse by claiming that He does. I personally lean toward Morse’s
    claim being wrong rather than attribute such deception to God.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having a seared conscience…
</p>
<p>
    Draw your own conclusions.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, Paul encourages us to “reject profane and old wives’ fables,
    and exercise yourself toward godliness (1 Timothy 4:7) and to be “nourished
    in the words of faith and of the <strong>good doctrine</strong> which you
    have carefully followed” (1 Timothy 4:6). So, we see that Paul is
    distinguishing demonic doctrine from good doctrine here. The doctrines of
    demons are profane old wives’ fables. I imagine a hellish playground in
    which demons joyfully dismember, boil, and creatively torture people
    qualifies for the “profane old wives’ fables” label. In context, good
    doctrine that leads to profitable godliness includes the following:
</p>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 4:9-11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end we
    both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is
    the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. These things
    command and teach.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is fascinating to me that 1 Timothy 4 exhorts us to command and teach
    that God is the Savior of all men, yet endless hell proponents say that
    this is heresy. Meanwhile, they cling to unbiblical myths that dehumanize
    and degrade people, to sadistic fantasies about relishing the suffering of
    the damned, and to an insistence that we must violate conscience and reason
    to be faithful to God. Such ploys are necessary strategies for calling the
    evil good and the good evil, for searing the conscience, cauterizing it so
    that it can no longer discern the difference.
</p>
<p>
    But these ideas are harmful and wrong. It is time to recognize them for
    what they are. This is not an attack on the church nor even on the people
    who have written such ideas. It is a call to reject that which is evil and
    cling to that which is good (Romans 12:9). I bet that Greg Morse is
    actually a nice guy who genuinely cares for people. Most people who claim
    to be Christians are kind-hearted and do care. But they often mistakenly
    believe that defending endless hell is necessary to defend biblical truth.
    In doing so, however, they create defenses that are neither biblical nor
    true. And in doing so, the church and the world suffer, the light of the
    gospel is dimmed, and people made in God’s image are dehumanized. This
    should not be so. Instead, we should be free from dark myths that
    dehumanize people and that restrict our ability to truly love others as
    Christ commanded. We must be free to share the love of the Savior of all
people (a love that always perseveres and never, ever fails)    <em>with all people</em>. But to experience this freedom, the church must
    reject the deeply incoherent tradition of endless hell that has enslaved us
    and obscured the true light of the gospel. It is not the cessation of
    eternal punishment that would “obscure the light of heaven” as Samuel
    Hopkins claimed, but rather the wretchedness of said doctrine that obscures
    the light of heaven from reaching a dark world that needs the light of
    God’s love.

    Note: There is another translation of <em>De Spectaculis</em> that reads
more smoothly in English that I originally found on    <a href="https://tentmaker.org/Quotes/hell-fire.htm">tentmaker.org.</a>
    Since it was difficult to find the translator, I used the translation cited
    above. I eventually found a source with a very similar translation from the
    18<sup>th</sup> century British historian Edward Gibbon. You can see it for
    yourself
