<h1>
    An Odd Argument for Literal Eternal Fire
</h1>
<p>
    One very interesting argument for literal eternal hellfire can be found on
    Matt Slick’s Christian Apologetics &amp; Research Ministry (CARM) website. It
    seems to be a pretty popular site for topics like this, since it was one of
    the first results on a Google search (I forget the search terms used at the
    moment). At any rate, here is a very telling part of his argument, quoted
    verbatim:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Some believe that the fires of hell are symbolic and/or temporal. But the
    following verses show that they are not.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		
        Matt. 3:12 says, "And His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear
    His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He
    will burn up the chaff with <strong>unquenchable</strong> fire." (See also
        Luke 3:17.)
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
        Mark 9:43
    
    says, "And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for
    you to enter life crippled, than having your two hands, to go into hell,
into the <strong>unquenchable</strong> fire." The word "unquenchable" is    <em>asbestos</em> in the Greek. According to the Enhanced Strong's lexicon,
    it means "unquenchable, the eternal hell fire to punish the damned."
	</blockquote>
<p>
    First, let’s address his claim that the Matthew 3:12 and Mark 9:43 show
    that the fires of hell are <em>not symbolic</em>. It is important to
    recognize that is his claim. The fires are literal, according to Slick, and
    he claims to show this to be true using the aforementioned verses. 
</p>
	<p>
    Here is
the problem with that: the verses he chose show    <em>precisely the opposite</em> of what he is claiming! The reason should
    be quite apparent, but let’s dissect the verses a bit just in case.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing that you should notice about Matthew 3:12 and Mark 9:43 is
that they use <em>highly symbolic, figurative</em> language    <em>throughout</em>. This can be illustrated rather simply. Reading Matthew
    3:12 through the literal lens proposed by Slick leads to the following
    interpretation:
</p>
<p>
    1. Jesus has a literal winnowing fork (a pitchfork) in his hand that he
    will use to clear a literal threshing floor.
</p>
<p>
    2. He will then gather literal wheat into a literal barn and burn up
    literal chaff with literal unquenchable fire.
</p>
<p>
    So, you see, the verse is not about hell for people at all; it’s about
    agriculture, and it’s describing Jesus as a literal farmer!
</p>
<p>
    But, of course, such a reading is ridiculous. No one, not even Slick,
    believes that to be a reasonable interpretation. Instead he proposes
    reading everything as symbolic and figurative except for the fire. So, we
have <em>figurative</em> wheat, <em>figurative</em> chaff, a    <em>figurative</em> winnowing fork, a <em>figurative</em> threshing floor,
    a <em>figurative</em> barn, but <em>literal</em> fire. Why the sudden
    change? Are we to believe the entire passage is symbolic except for the
    fire?
</p>
<p>
    Such a reading violates common sense and is exegetically absurd. Using a
    passage that is <em>entirely symbolic</em> as a proof text to claim that
    the fire must <em>not be symbolic</em> is beyond bizarre.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, he makes the same mistake again in his claim that Mark 9:43 proves the
    fire to be literal, not symbolic. Again, I am doubting that he actually
    believes that Jesus is advising self-mutilation and that we should
    literally cut off our hands, or as He says in another verse, pluck out our
    eyes if they cause us to sin. The picture of Matt Slick on his website
    shows him to have two eyes as far as I can tell (although his hands are not
    shown, so I cannot confirm 100% that he has not cut them off).
    Nevertheless, I am quite confident that he, as well as almost everyone,
    understands Jesus words in a figurative sense. They are strong, symbolic
    words that are meant to emphasize the seriousness of sin and the need to
    repent of it rather than practice it. To interpret the verse literally
    requires people to mutilate themselves or disobey Jesus’ words in refusing
    to do so. To arbitrarily decide that Jesus suddenly goes from clearly
    figurative language to stark literalism without any warning is senseless.
    To claim such a text as proof that he does so is even worse.
</p>
<p>
    The sad reality, however, is that many Christians have become so
    conditioned to accepting this type of nonsense that they do not even
    realize what is being said. The argument is confirming of the bias that
    they already hold, so they do not read it critically or consider its
    obvious irrationality. People need to begin to read with
    their eyes open and their brains turned on! To not do so and insist on
    unreasonable interpretations of Scripture maligns God to the world and
    makes Christians look empty-headed. Remember, Jesus told us to love God
    with all our <em>minds</em>, not just our hearts, souls and strengths (Luke
    10:27).
</p>
<p>
    In the Bible, fire is used symbolically regularly, and very frequently
    to symbolize purification. This is why Jesus will baptize us “with the Holy
    Spirit and with fire” (Matthew 3:11) and why “<em>everyone</em> will be
    salted with fire” (Mark 9:49). God Himself is even described as a consuming
    fire on multiple occasions, and metallurgical imagery of using fire to
    purify people as gold is purified of dross is pervasive (to review a
    sampling of these verses click
    <a href="../4_Symbolism/2_fireandworms.html">
        here</a>). To insist that the fire must be literal and ignore all of these passages
    is wholly unreasonable.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, Slick is not the only defender of literal hellfire to do so. Such 
	claims were, in fact, normative during the darkest ages of church history and
    are still promoted today. The famous Charles Spurgeon, for example, makes
    similar claims:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		There is a real fire in hell, as truly as you have now a real body—a fire
    exactly like that which we have on earth in everything except this—that it
    will not consume, though it will torture you. You have seen the asbestos
    lying in the fire red hot, but when you take it out it is unconsumed. So
    your body will be prepared by God in such a way that it will burn for ever
    without being consumed; it will lie, not as you consider, in a metaphorical
    fire, but in actual flame ... body and soul shall be together, each
    brimfull of pain, thy soul sweating in its inmost pore drops of blood, and
    thy body from head to foot suffused with agony; conscience, judgment,
    memory, all tortured, but more—thy head tormented with racking pains, thine
    eyes starting from their sockets with sights of blood and woe; thine ears
    tormented with
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		"Sullen moans and hollow groans.
    <br/>
    And shrieks of tortured ghosts."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Thine heart beating high with fever; thy pulse rattling at an enormous rate
    in agony; thy limbs crackling like the martyrs in the fire, and yet
    unburnt; thyself, put in a vessel of hot oil, pained, yet coming out
    undestroyed; all thy veins becoming a road for the hot feet of pain to
    travel on; every nerve a string on which the devil shall ever play his
    diabolical tune of Hell's Unutterable Lament; thy soul for ever and ever
    aching, and thy body palpitating in unison with thy soul. Fictions, sir!
    Again, I say, they are no fictions, and as God liveth, but solid, stern
    truth. (Spurgeon 1856)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    I think that, right there, is what it is to take God’s name in vain. To
    swear that <em>as God lives</em>, your grotesque imaginings are “solid,
    stern truth” is a horrible perversion of Scripture. Where, I ask, does
    Spurgeon find the imagery of being boiled in oil, or of having our limbs
    crackling like logs, or of every vein becoming a road for excruciating pain, or of the devil playing his diabolical tune by using
    our nerves like guitar strings?&nbsp; Where does he get his ghoulish poem about
    the sullen moans, hollow groans, and shrieks of tortured ghosts? I can
    guarantee that none of it is from the Bible itself. It is purely dark ages
    fantasy designed to terrify people. Furthermore, it glorifies the devil by
    giving him incredible power, even in hell. And yet Spurgeon swears on God’s
    life that it is true! The fact that many popular preachers and theologians
    are willing to play so fast and loose with the Bible should give us pause
    and make us wonder how trustworthy they are as sources biblical truth.
</p>
<h2>
    The Unquenchable Question
</h2>
<p>
    You may be thinking presently that I have only addressed the first part of
    Slick’s argument. You may agree that the “evidence” he uses to back up his
    claim that the fire is not symbolic is less than compelling (if you are a
    fan of understatement). But you may still be wondering about the eternality
    aspect of the fire. I have addressed this already
    <a href="../4_Symbolism/2_fireandworms.html">
        here
    </a>
    (where the term unquenchable is discussed), as well as
    <a
        href="../3_Is_Hell_Biblical/3_the_eternal_question.html"
    >
        here</a>,
    <a
        href="../3_Is_Hell_Biblical/4_eternal_confusion.html"
    >
        here</a>, and
    <a
        href="../3_Is_Hell_Biblical/4.1%20more_eternal_passages.html"
    >
        here
    </a>&nbsp;where the terms used for “eternity” are analyzed. Nevertheless, it may be
    wise to reiterate the true meaning of the word “unquenchable” since he
    bases his claim that the fire of hell is not temporal <em>exclusively</em>
    on it. It really has the sense of being unstoppable, and that it will fully
    complete its work. The reason that Slick uses the Enhanced Strong's lexicon
    to define the word is because it is <em>enhanced</em>. In other words, it
    is loaded with a particular interpretation that he prefers, saying that it
    means "unquenchable, <em>the eternal hell fire to punish the damned.</em>"
    The italicized portion is the “enhanced” part (i.e. the part that is not
    actually a definition at all).
</p>
<p>
This is fairly easy to demonstrate. In the original Greek the word used is    <em>asbestos</em> (ἄσβεστος) which is a compound word consisting of two
    parts
</p>
<p>
    1. ἄ (a) which means “not.” English, by the way, uses this same convention
in words like <em>a</em>biotic (which means not biotic/not living) or    <em>a</em>synchronous (which means not synchronous) etc.
</p>
<p>
    2. <em>sbestos</em> which is a form of the word <em>sbennumi </em>
    (σβέννυμι) which means “to quench.”
</p>
<div class="box">
&nbsp;You can confirm this for yourself <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/762.htm">here</a> and    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/4570.htm">here</a>.
</div>
<p>
    These words are also used in the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation
    of the Old Testament). Jesus is clearly alluding to Isaiah 66:24 when he
    says that the fire is “unquenchable” or that it will “not be quenched.” The
    exact construction of the phase in this verse is ου σβεσθήσεται which is
    synonymous with <em>asbestos</em>:
</p>
<p>
    1. ου means “not.”
</p>
<p>
2. σβεσθήσεται<em> </em>(<em>sbesthesetai)</em> is a form of the word    <em>sbennumi </em>(σβέννυμι) which means “to quench.”
</p>
<p>
    So, <em>asbestos</em> has exactly the same meaning (not to quench) and is
derived from the exact same root word (<em>sbennumi</em>) as <em>ου</em>    <em>sbesthesetai. </em>It just uses “a” instead of “<em>οu</em>” to mean
    “not.”
</p>
<p>
    With this in mind, let’s look at one other verse that uses the same exact
    Greek words as Isaiah 66:24 to describe fire:
</p>
	<h3>
    <strong><u>Leviticus 6:12-13 (NET)</u></strong>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		But the fire which is on the altar must be kept burning on it. It must    <em>not be extinguished</em> (<em>ου</em> <em>sbesthesetai</em>). So the
    priest must kindle wood on it morning by morning, and he must arrange the
    burnt offering on it and offer the fat of the peace offering up in smoke on
it. A continual fire must be kept burning on the altar. It must    <em>not be extinguished</em> (<em>ου</em> <em>sbesthesetai</em>).
	</blockquote>
	<div class="box">
		Note that the Greek here is from a Septuagint interlinear which
you can get for yourself    <a href="https://apostolicbible.com/text.htm">here</a>. In the original
    Hebrew, the words for “not quenched” are (<em>tikbeh lo</em>) as we already
    discussed
    <a href="../4_Symbolism/2_fireandworms.html">
        here
    </a>
    .
</div>
<p>
    Since these fires did in fact go out, and the Jewish sacrificial system is
    no longer practiced, we know that the meaning Jesus alluded to is not one of
    absolute endlessness. Instead, this fire was not to be put out by anyone
    until its purpose was fulfilled. In the same way, the chastising fire
    described by Jesus will not be stopped or put out by any person. Instead it
    will complete its work of purification.
</p>
<p>
    J.W. Hanson also gives us historical evidence that the Greek-speaking
    people did not understand the term “<em>asbestos</em>” to denote
    endlessness, telling us that the church historian Eusebius “twice calls the
    fire that consumed two martyrs unquenchable (<em>asbesto puri</em>).” I
    cross verified this fact. It occurs in book IV, chapter 41 (sections 15 and
    17) of his <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, and is quoted in the following
    passage, describing the martyrdom of several Alexandrian Christians:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"The first of these was Julian, a man afflicted with the gout, neither able
    to walk nor stand, who with two others that carried him, was arraigned. Of
    these, the one immediately denied, but the other, named Cronion, surnamed
    Eunus, and the aged Julian himself, having confessed the Lord, was carried
    on camels throughout the city - a very large one as you know - and in this
elevation were scourged, and finally consumed in an    <strong>immense fire - (<em>puri asbesto.</em>)</strong>… After these,
    Epimachus and Alexander, who had continued for a long time in prison,
    enduring innumerable sufferings from the scourges and scrapers, were also
destroyed in an <strong>immense fire - (<em>puri asbesto</em>)</strong>.” (Laing 1878)
	</blockquote>
<p>
In these same passages of <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> from    <em>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, </em>Arthur Cushman McGiffert
    translated <em>puri asbesto </em>as “a <em>fierce</em> fire.”
</p>
<p>
    It is critical to note that the words “<em>puri asbesto</em>” are the exact
    same words used in Matthew 3:12, Mark 9:43/9:45, and Luke 3:17, in which
    they are often translated as “unquenchable fire.” This is certainly
    conclusive proof that ancient Greek-speaking individuals did not believe
    the term to denote endless suffering. Are we to believe that Eusebius
    thought of the fires that consumed these Christian martyrs as still
    tormenting them?&nbsp; Is he claiming that they are still experiencing <em>
	"the eternal hell fire to punish the damned" </em>as Slick's reference to 
	Strong's "enhanced<em>" </em>lexicon tries to lead you to believe?<em>&nbsp; </em>Of course not! Eusebius knew that these fires had gone out
    long ago and still he used the term “<em>asbesto</em>.” This is why the
    translators did not translate Eusebius' words as “unquenchable”: such a term
    wrongly implies endlessness (to conditioned English speakers) which is, of
    course, obviously not what Eusebius is describing. This demonstrates beyond
    any reasonable doubt that <em>asbestos</em> need not denote endless
    suffering in literal fire as Matt Slick claims. And since this is his sole
    basis for claiming that the fires of hell are not temporal, his argument
    fails.
</p>
<p>
    Now some may argue that there are other reasons to insist on the
    never-ending nature of the fire, by quoting other verses that have words
    like “forever and ever” and “eternal” to describe “hell.” We have already
    spent a lot of time debunking those claims (and the links to read those 
	chapters are available on this page), so I will not re-hash all of them again. Instead, I
    will allow you to consider the words of another scholar on the matter of
    eternity in the Bible.
</p>
<p>
    George Campbell Morgan D.D. was certainly no “liberal” theologian. He was a
    friend of Charles Spurgeon (whose preaching we just looked at) and other
famous preachers of his day and he contributed an essay to    <em>The Fundamentals</em>, a series of 90 essays “which are widely
    considered to be the foundation of the modern Fundamentalist movement”
    ("Overview - G. Campbell Morgan's Exposition on the Whole Bible"). It is
    highly doubtful that he believed in universal salvation. Nevertheless, he
    is honest and correct in his assessment of the status of the concept of
    eternity in the biblical text:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Let me say to Bible students that we must be very careful how we use the
    word “eternity.” We have fallen into great error in our constant usage of
    that word. There is no word in the whole Book of God corresponding with our
    “eternal,” which as commonly used among us, means absolutely without end…
    Men have divided the Church, separated from each other, and persecuted one
    another, upon a thought conveyed by an English word which has no equivalent
    in the Bible… God is subject to no limitation, and our finite thought must
    utterly fail to fathom the ages which He inhabits. We have no right to
    dogmatize upon anything beyond what is written; nor should we use a human
    word to express Divine things in the great future, concerning which we know
    so little. (Morgan, in <em>God’s Methods with Man</em>… pages 185-186)
	</blockquote>
<h2>
    Recap
</h2>
<p>
    Matt Slick’s usage of Matthew 3:12 and Mark 9:43 to claim that the fires of
    hell are not symbolic and not temporal fails on both fronts for the following reasons:
</p>
<p>
    1. He uses obviously symbolic, figurative verses as “proof” that the fires
    are <em>not </em>symbolic<em> </em>or figurative.&nbsp; This patently makes no
    sense.&nbsp; Instead of insisting that just one part of a verse is literal and
    the rest symbolic (and then swear on God's life that our gruesome imaginary 
	embellishments are stern solid truth), we should ask ourselves what the symbolism refers to
    biblically. In the case of fire, the symbol very often refers to
    purification.
</p>
<p>
    2. The word translated as “unquenchable” does not have the sense of eternal
    suffering in the original Greek. This is proven by the fact that the Bible
    itself uses the term of fires that have in fact gone out, and by the fact
    that Greek-speakers used the term for fires that were clearly temporary,
    such as the fires Eusebius describes that killed the Alexandrian martyrs.
</p>
<p>
    3. Many scholars (cited in this chapter and elsewhere) admit that there is
    no term for “eternal” in the Bible itself in its original languages and
    that it is a major mistake to insist on using that word and dogmatizing on
    it. Nevertheless, dogmatizing is exactly what most modern pastors and
    theologians do when they insist that everyone must believe in eternal
    conscious torment to be Christian.
</p>
<p>
    By recognizing the biblical symbolism of fire and a right understanding of
the biblical terms used to describe the disciplinary punishment of sin (<em>asbestos, aionas aionon</em>, <em>aionios</em>, <em>kolasin</em>,
    etc.), we can be free from unreasonable interpretations that so often
    confuse both believers and non-believers as to God’s nature and purpose.
