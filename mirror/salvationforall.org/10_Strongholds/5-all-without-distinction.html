<h1>
    All Without Distinction?
</h1>
<p>
    One of the most common tactics used to attempt to contradict the many Bible
    verses that support universal salvation is to claim that the word “all”
    does not mean “all without exception” but instead “all without
    distinction.” I have lost count of the number of times I have read or heard
    this supposed “explanation” for why God will not save everyone even though
    He is “the Savior of all people” (1 Timothy 4:10) who is reconciling “all”
    to Himself (Colossians 1, 2 Corinthians 5) etc. This, however, is
    tantamount to saying that “all” actually means “some” and is therefore an
    invalid claim that simply seeks to redefine the word “all” to fit
    preconceived religious paradigms. In short, it is pure sophistry
    (fallacious, deceptive argumentation).
</p>
<p>
    Keith DeRose, Yale professor of philosophy, summarizes this argument and
    his conclusion as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Several people I’ve spoken with about our universalist passages had
    apparently been taught that “all” can mean “all without distinction” rather
    than “all without exception”. What exactly is “all” supposed to mean when
    it carries the former (“without distinction”) sense? Some seem to hold that
    it then means “some from each group”, and where it’s people that are
    involved, each group seems to mean each nation. For others, it means
    something a bit more: That every person, regardless of which group she’s
    in, has a chance.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		But it’s clear that “all”, at least when used properly, never means
    anything like that.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    When used properly, “all” <em>never </em>means “some from each group,”
    according to DeRose (and common sense/reason). In his explanation of why
    all cannot mean “all without distinction,” DeRose has a good analogy about
    a “slippery character” who attempts to use “all” in this way that shows
this quite clearly (you can read it    <a href="http://campuspress.yale.edu/keithderose/1129-2/#3">here</a>). But
    rather than quote this analogy, I have another one.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine that an incredibly powerful leader decides to form his own island
    nation with people from all over the world coming to populate it. This
    leader, who we will call King Bobo, has virtually unlimited resources and
    power. He is the sovereign, supreme leader of his land. At the start of
    this most remarkable nation, King Bobo makes the following proclamation:
</p>
<p>
    “Loyal subjects, this day begins a new nation in which liberty, justice,
    and human rights will reign for <em>all people</em>. <em>All</em> will be
    treated with dignity and respect. <em>All</em> will be happy and well-fed.
    The finest medical facilities, procedures, and medicines will be freely
    available to <em>all people</em> in my land. As I live, I swear that this
    new nation will truly be a nation of liberty and justice for <em>all</em>!”
</p>
<p>
    Everyone cheers the speech, confetti flies, the marching band plays, and so
    begins this great nation.
</p>
<p>
    Now imagine several years later, the United Nations sends a representative
    to check out this country, only to find that the vast majority of its
    population is enslaved, malnourished, abused, exploited, sick,
    impoverished, and victimized. Human rights violations abound,
    government-sanctioned torture is common place, and King Bobo is directly
    responsible for all of it.
</p>
<p>
    Naturally, the U.N. is concerned, creates a human rights panel, and
    investigates King Bobo. As part of the process, the king himself is called
    upon to defend himself before the panel. Imagine their dialogue:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		U.N. guy: “King Bobo, your kingdom is full of human rights abuses. You
    swore at its inauguration that <em>all people</em> would be treated with
    dignity and respect, that <em>all</em> would have access to medical care,
    food, and basic necessities. You swore that <em>all</em> would have
    liberty, justice, and happiness. Yet, most of your subjects live in
    slavery, agony and need. You abuse, exploit, and torture them constantly.
    It is clear that you lied about your kingdom. Give us one good reason not
    to imprison you for crimes against humanity.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		King Bobo: “Your honor, I did not lie.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		U.N guy: “Have you been paying attention! Of course you lied!”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		King Bobo: “Did not!”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		U.N. guy: “Did too!”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    [repeat childish banter several times]
</p>
	<blockquote>
		King Bobo: “Did not! You see, when I said <em>all people</em> would receive
    all those good things, human rights and so on, blah, blah, blah, I meant
    “all without distinction.” So, I used the 1910 data on the Regional
    Distribution of Christians shown below to separate my population into
    groups according to their regions of origin: Europe, the Americas,
    Asia-Pacific, Middle East-North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on
    this data, I was sure to treat <em>at least some people, at random </em>
    from each of these groups with dignity and respect. So, for the European
    group for example, I had a random lottery of the whole population and 66.3%
    of that group received all of the benefits I promised. For the Middle
    Eastern-North African group, I did the same thing and 0.7% of that group
    received all of the benefits I promised, and so on for the other groups. So
you see, <em>all people </em>did receive what I promised,    <em>all without distinction</em>, that is. Can I go home now?”

</p>
	<blockquote>
		U.N. panel (all together): “That was a very persuasive argument King Bobo.
    You even have a pie chart! We had forgotten about the “all without
distinction” loophole. I guess you really are a good king, who treats    <em>all people</em>, that is “all people without distinction” very well in
    your kingdom. Keep up the good work.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		King Bobo: “Thank you, your honors, I knew you would see reason in this
    matter. If you need to find me again, I’ll be torturing some Middle Eastern
    and Asian peasants in my palace, for fun, because I can.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This ridiculous scenario well-illustrates the patent nonsense of the “all
    without distinction” claim. “All without distinction” simply isn’t a thing.
    As DeRose aptly observes:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		This won’t fly, precisely because “all” just can’t mean anything like what
    the “all without distinction” crowd says it sometimes means. My reaction,
    at least, is not that this fellow was being deceitful merely in using one
    sense of “all” while it has another good sense. He’s worse than that:
    There’s <u>no</u> good sense of “all” that would make true his miserable
    lie. No, “all”, when it’s used properly, always means all without
    exception. Quite simply, “all” means all.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    You may now object, however, that “all” in the King Bobo analogy doesn’t
    mean “all people everywhere” but only those in King Bobo’s land. So, “all”
    doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean everyone in the universe. But don’t get
    too excited about a limited soteriology (view of salvation) yet. “All”
    still really does mean “all” not “some from each group (all without
    distinction).” To see why, let’s turn again to Dr. DeRose:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		What’s going on here is that the quantifier phrases of natural language
    (“all”, “most”, “some”, etc.) are to be understood, on an occasion of use,
    relative to a contextually determined domain. Thus, when I say, “All the
    beer is warm”, the contextually determined domain is the things in this
    room, so “All the beer”, in context, means all the beer in this room. So
    there is <u>some</u> sense in which “all” doesn’t always mean all: On some
occasions of use, “all” … means all … within a limited domain. But,    <u>relative to that domain</u>, “all” really does mean all (without
    exception): My sentence “All the beer is warm” turns out to be false if
    there is some cold beer that I failed to notice in the room.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		But when the domain is limited, there has to be some fairly clear clue as
    to what the limited domain is. When “all” is used in the New Testament, as
    in “For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God,” and similar
    passages, the “all”, I take it, refers to all people. It could possibly
    refer to some restricted class of people, but that suggestion is to be
    rejected, b/c (a) there is no such restricted class that clearly presents
    itself (all the people in this room?), (b) it’s incumbent on a speaker to
    make clear what the class is if he means for it to be specially restricted
    and no specially restricted class clearly presents itself given current
    conversational intents and purposes, and (c) the NT doesn’t specify any
    such specially restricted class. So, “All have sinned” means that all
    people have sinned, as almost all would agree.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		But similarly for the “all”s of the universalist passages. No restricted
    class of people clearly presents itself, and the Biblical writers aren’t so
    incompetent as to mean some specially restricted class of people that
    doesn’t clearly present itself without specifying or somehow making it
    clear which class they mean. Indeed, in I Corinthians 15:22 and Romans
    5:18, each of the relevant “all”s occur in the very same sentence (and a
    fairly short sentence, to boot) as an occurrence of “all” that seems to
    refer to the whole human race (given that it’s the whole human race that
    died/was condemned in Adam), so it would have been especially misleading or
    even incompetent for Paul to mean something less than the whole human race
    there, since that would involve switching the domains relative to which his
    claims should be interpreted without warning in the middle of a single
    sentence — and a sentence that seems to be stressing the parallelism
    between its two clauses, for that matter. So I see no reasonable
    alternative but to conclude that these “all”s refer to all people.

<p>
    Thus, if a clearly limited context is described, I can use the term “all”
    to mean “all in this context.” So, for example, since King Bobo only has
    authority over his kingdom, he is only able to make human rights guarantees
    for people in his kingdom. In this case, the context is clearly limited to
    his kingdom over which he has authority. Of course, this begs the question:
    Over whom and over what does God have authority? Is he not the Lord of all,
    and does He not have authority over everything (without exception)? Didn’t
    Jesus say, in 17:2 that the Father had given Him “authority over all
    people.” Is God really “over all” (Ephesians 4:6) or is He only sovereign
    over some (all without distinction)?
</p>
<p>
    As DeRose points out, if the biblical authors meant to restrict the word
    “all” to a particular limited context, they would have done so (but they
    did not). They are not “so incompetent as to mean some specially restricted
    class of people that doesn’t clearly present itself without specifying or
    somehow making it clear which class they mean.” Not only do they neglect to
    mention any specially restricted domain, the biblical writers explicitly
    tell us that the domain they are referring to is all-inclusive. Consider
    the following examples:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 5:18
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for <em>all men</em>, so one
    act of righteousness leads to justification and life for <em>all men</em>.
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Corinthians 15:22
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For as in Adam <em>all die</em>, so also in Christ shall    <em>all be made alive</em>.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    These are the two verses that Keith DeRose discussed above. He is right to
    point out that both of these short single-sentence verses exhibit clearly
    parallel clauses in which the first clause really means all people. It is
    strange indeed to interpret the first clause as “all without exception”
    (which is certainly how it is interpreted by most Christians who believe
    that all mankind is condemned to die in Adam), but the second parallel
    clause as “all without distinction.” A mid-sentence switch in scope without
    any warning or contextual clues, would indeed be “misleading or even
    incompetent” especially since the sentences are “stressing the parallelism
    between [their] two clauses.” Thus, if Adam’s sin led to condemnation and
    death for all people, Christ’s sacrifice necessarily leads to justification
    and life for all people. If we deny that one means everyone, we must
    logically deny that the other means everyone.
</p>
<h3>
    Colossians 1:15-20
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over    <em>all creation</em>. For in him
    <em>
        all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and
        invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all
        things have been created through him and for him.
    </em>
    He is before <em>all things</em>, and in him <em>all things</em> hold
    together. And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning
    and the firstborn from among the dead, so that <em>in everything</em> he
    might have the supremacy. For God was pleased to have all his fullness
    dwell in him,
    <em>
        and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on
        earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on
        the cross
    </em>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that “all things” includes everything (in heaven, on earth, visible,
    invisible etc.) and that Paul makes this emphatically clear. It is the same
    ”all things” that He created that He is reconciling to Himself by making
    peace through his blood, shed on the cross. Are we to honestly believe that
    He created “all things without distinction” rather than literally all
    things? If Paul means that God literally created all things in Christ, it
    is inevitable that he is “to reconcile to himself” those same created
    things through Him.
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 1:8-10
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his
    will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put
into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—    <em>to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ</em>.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, the contextual domain is all things in heaven and on earth. So, this
    clearly includes everything since there is no other place. But in case you
    feel all things in heaven and on earth is not specific enough, other verses
    go into more detail:
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 5:13
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Then I heard
    <em>
        every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the
        sea, and all that is in them
    </em>
    , saying:
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		be praise and honor and glory and power,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		for ever and ever!”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here, it is even more specific that all creatures everywhere will worship
    Jesus, the Lamb of God. The contextual domain includes “every creature
    <em>
        in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that
        is in them,”
    </em>
    which adds “under the earth” and “on the sea” and “all that is in them” to
    clarify unambiguously that all means all, not just some. Every creature in
    every place the author can think of. ALL.
</p>
<h3>
    Philippians 2:9-11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is
    above <em>every </em>name,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>so that at the name
of Jesus <em>every</em> knee should bow,    <em>in heaven and on earth and under the earth</em>, and <em>every</em>
    tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The contextual domain is, again, very clearly universal as he is referring
    to everyone <em>in heaven and on earth and under the earth</em>. All of the
    uses of the word “every” italicized above are inflections of the same Greek
    word translated as “all” in our other passages: <em>pas</em> (πᾶς, Strong’s
    # 3956). As a reminder, inflections do not change the meaning of the word,
    but rather simply make the word fit grammatically in the sentence. The
    Greek words for “bow” and “confess” are very clearly describing
    wholehearted worship, as we have already discussed. It is simply absurd to
    suggest that Jesus name is above “every type of name without distinction”
    and that “every type of knee without distinction” will bow, and that “every
    type of tongue without distinction” will confess. Jesus’ name is not really
    above every name, but rather just above every type of name? What are these
    alleged “types of names” or “types of knees” or “types of tongues?”
    Clearly, every individual, everywhere is in view. Paul is being about as
    clear as he could possibly be about his contextual domain: it is universal, 
	including all people everywhere.
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 3:23
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		for <strong>all</strong> have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,…
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Answer the following question: Does this verse refer to all people without
    exception or all people without distinction? As a reminder, here is what is
    meant by these terms:
</p>
<h4>
    Option 1: All people without exception
</h4>
<p>
    This means that every person has sinned and falls short of the glory of God
    (excluding Jesus himself). There are no perfect, sinless people; all people
    without exception sin.
</p>
<h4>
    Option 2: All people without distinction
</h4>
<p>
    This means that at least some people from each group of people have sinned
    and fall short of the glory of God. Not every individual has sinned. Some
    people from each group have, but there are also sinless individuals in each
    group who have not fallen short of God’s glory.
</p>
<p>
    Which is it? Option 1 or Option 2? Is it really all people, or only some?
</p>
<p>
    Commit to your answer.
</p>
<p>
    I am betting that you chose option 1 (all without exception). Everyone has
    sinned and fallen short of God’s glory. If you did not, I am wondering who
    you know that I don’t, because they must be pretty amazing (having never
    sinned and having attained the glory of God). So, I’ll just assume that
    pretty much everyone believes that all people without exception have sinned
    and fallen short of God’s glory.
</p>
<p>
    But here’s the kicker. Romans 3:23 is not actually a full sentence. More of
    the sentence continues in Romans 3:24. Here they are together:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 3:23-24
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
    by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, …
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here’s the really important thing to notice: the “all” refers to every 
	person without exception!&nbsp; Everyone has sinned and everyone is justified by his grace as a gift. It is the same “all”
    that serves as the subject for both clauses since the word “all” only
    occurs once in the original Greek. If all without exception have sinned and
    fallen short, all without exception are justified by his grace as a gift,
    since the exact same people are being referred to by “all.” If we insist on
    universal sin, we must also insist on universal justification as a gift.
    You cannot grammatically or logically divide Romans 3:23 and 3:24 as if
    they refer to two separate groups of people; they are one and the same.
</p>
<h4>
    Are There Different Greek Words that Mean the Different “Types of All”?
</h4>
<p>
    I think that the assumption that there is a special Greek word for “all
    without distinction” as compared to “all without exception” is probably a
    common misconception among those who have not studied Greek. The fact is
that there is only one word being used in all these passages. It is    <em>pas</em> (πᾶς, Strong’s # 3956), as we mentioned before. It is
    impossible to consistently interpret “all” as “all without distinction” and
    have it be a worthwhile word. If we interpret “all” this way, it gives us
    no assurance of salvation even for believers. Verses like Acts 2:21, which
    says that “everyone (<em>pas</em>) who calls upon the name of the Lord
    shall be saved” end up meaning that “at least some people who call upon the
    Lord from each group of people will be saved.” So, some Gentiles who call
    upon the Lord will be saved and some Jews who call upon the Lord will be
    saved, but not all people without exception who call upon the Lord will be
    saved. For all we know, only one Jewish person and one Gentile are actually
    saved, since this fulfills the condition of the “all without distinction”
    view that at least someone from each “group” has to make it. And how do we
    determine what constitutes a group anyway? Is it race, ethnicity, age,
    socioeconomic status, eye color, religion, dental health, or what? This
    introduces an incredible amount of ambiguity to a very simple, clear word.
</p>
<p>
    So, since a consistent interpretation is not possible, what is being done
    is a metaphorical sleight of hand. The theologian who wishes to redefine
    “all” to mean “all without distinction” is arbitrarily deciding when to use
    each “definition.” So, if the verse is about condemnation, death, sin, or
    anything negative, “all” means “all without exception.” If, however, it is
    about being made alive, reconciled, saved, or united in Christ or anything
    positive, then “all” means “all without distinction.” This is nothing short
    of smoke and mirrors, a deceptive illusion that can be manipulated however
    it is most convenient for retaining one’s theological system and ignoring
    any verses that don’t fit.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Mere Christianity</em>, C.S. Lewis aptly observes the tendency to
    redefine a word that has a clear meaning in such a way that the word’s
    meaning is lost, at which point it becomes virtually useless. This is
    precisely what is being attempted with the word “all” in the current
    theological landscape. If “all” really means “some” then why have the word
    “all” at all. It becomes meaningless. Of course, it was not meaningless
    when the biblical writers used it, and no amount of sophistry or smoke and
    mirrors can change that.
