<h1>
    <u>What are We Saved From?</u>
</h1>
<p>
    The prevailing notion on salvation in most churches today seems to be that
    we are saved from hell. In fact, most gospel presentations seem to
    emphasize this point as well as the converse destination for those who
    believe: heaven. There seems to be little discussion of the effect of
    salvation in our lives presently. Rather it is relegated a future event
    post-mortem.
</p>
<p>
    But what does the Bible say about salvation? You may be surprised that the
    concept of being saved from hell is never discussed in the Bible. Instead,
    the Bible speaks of salvation from our <em>sins.</em>
</p>
<p>
    You don’t believe me? Let’s examine some passages.
</p>
<h3>

        >
            Matthew 1:21
        </a>
   
</h3>
<blockquote>
    She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
because he will <strong>save</strong> <strong>his</strong>    <strong>people</strong> <strong>from their sins.”</strong>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+26:18&amp;version=NIV"
        >
            Acts 26:15-18
        </a>
    
</h3>
<blockquote>
"Then I asked, 'Who are you Lord?'
<br>
‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,’ 
	the Lord replied. ‘Now 
	get up and stand on your feet.&nbsp; I 
	have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what 
	you have seen and will see of me.&nbsp; I will rescue you from 
	your own people and from the Gentiles.&nbsp; I am sending you to them to open their eyes and <strong>turn them from darkness to light</strong>,
    and <strong>from</strong><strong> the power of Satan to God</strong>, so
    that they may
    <strong>
        receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified
        by faith in me.’
    </strong>

    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that
    they have been <strong>cleansed from their past sins.</strong>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Luke 1:67-79 (Zechariah’s Song)
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
    
    His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
</p>
<p>
    
    “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
    <br/>
    because he has come to his people and redeemed them.
    <br/>
    
    He has raised up a horn
    of salvation for us
    <br/>
    in the house of his servant David
    <br/>
    
    (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
    <br/>
    
    <strong>
        salvation from our enemies
        <br/>
        and from the hand of all who hate us
    </strong>
    —
    <br/>
   
    to show mercy to our ancestors
    <br/>
    and to remember his holy covenant,
    <br/>
    
    the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
    <br/>
   
    to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,
    <br/>
    and to enable us to serve him without fear
    <br/>
    
    in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
</p>
<p>
    
    And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
    <br/>
    for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
    <br/>
    
    to give his people the knowledge of salvation
    <br/>
    through the <strong>forgiveness of their sins,</strong>
    <br/>
   
    because of the <strong>tender mercy of our God,</strong>
    <br/>
    by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
    <br/>
    
    to shine on those living in darkness
    <br/>
    and in the shadow of death,
    <br/>
    <strong>to guide our feet into the path of peace.</strong>
    ”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    There is a clear theme to these verses: salvation from sin and from our
    enemies. We know who our primary enemy is from 1 Peter 5:8 which tells us
    to “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a
    roaring lion looking for someone to devour.”
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    We aren’t just saved from a <em>future</em> destination, but from a way of
    life in the present. We are saved from our bondage to sin and the influence
    of Satan in our lives. We are saved from destructive choices that tear
    apart families and destroy relationships.
</p>
<p>
    “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do
    not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery” (Galatians 5:1).
    This freedom from sin and from the law of man-made religion, allows us to
    serve and love God as well as our neighbors, as we act as subjects of the
    kingdom of God on earth. As Jesus said, “the kingdom of God is in your
    midst” (Luke 17:21). We get to show God’s kingdom to the earth as He
    sanctifies us and allows us to participate in the work He is doing.
</p>
<p>
    Notice the process of salvation:
</p>
<p>
    “For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
    but to us <strong>who are being saved</strong> it is the power of God” (1
    Corinthians 1:18).
</p>
<p>
    This makes sense if we are continuing to be sanctified and saved from our
    sins as we continue to follow Christ. It makes very little sense if we
    think of salvation only as a one time event that rescues us from a future
    hellish destination.
</p>
<p>
    We should be aware, however, that there are great future benefits that we
    receive through trusting in Jesus and following Him. Consider the
    following:
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20%3A6&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Revelation 20:6
    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such
    the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of
    Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that believers get to reign with Christ for a thousand years and
    that the second death has no power over us. The second death is also
    described as the lake of fire, and we get to avoid this. But I believe this
    second death is not an eternal torture chamber (for many Scriptural
    reasons) but rather a process of purification (albeit painful), as we will
    see later.
</p>
<p>
    While the book of Revelation also makes it clear that we are saved from the
    second death as believers this doesn’t seem to be the primary thrust of the
    salvation message. And we will soon see that the second death isn’t really
    best interpreted as the hell of eternal torment you’ve been told about.
    More on that to come.
</p>
	<p>
    But before we get to the symbolism of the second death, let's consider some 
	more Biblical evidence for God's great design to save all of humanity.&nbsp;
