<h1>Salvation for all people (Is it Biblical?)</h1>

<p>
    As discussed in the introduction, the title for this argument is based on
Titus 2:11 which states, “For the grace of God has appeared,    <strong>bringing salvation for all people</strong>,…” This verse alone
    should at least make you consider the possibility that all people are
    eventually saved. 
</p>
	<p>
    Perhaps, however, you might think that this is an
    isolated verse, taken out of context and twisted to mean something other
    than its true meaning. It is true that this can be done and that it is a
    common tactic of Satan for deceiving people. He even tried it on Jesus when
    he was being tempted in the desert.
</p>
<p>
    A bit of scripture, out of context, twisted to mean something it never
    meant… It’s a powerful way to lie, especially to the religious, especially
    if they feel obligated to believe what you say. Well, imaginary skeptic,
    I’m glad you brought that up… we’ll discuss that idea more in later
    chapters and you might be surprised what you discover.
</p>
<p>
    As it turns out, the skeptical claims proposed above are actually baseless.
    There are an incredible number of verses (especially incredible if you’ve
    been taught that the salvation of all mankind is heretical) that plainly
    tell us that Jesus Christ will save all people. All of them speak for
    themselves, but I’ll discuss a few of them that are especially interesting.
    Let’s take a look.
</p>
	<h2>The Savior of All People</h2>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A10&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 Timothy 4:9-10 (ESV)
    </a>
    
</h3>
<blockquote>
This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.    <strong><sup> </sup></strong>That is why we labor and strive, because we
    have put our hope in the living God, who is
    <strong>
        the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe
    </strong>
    .
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that God is the <em>Savior of all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</em>The title of Savior can only apply if He indeed saves.&nbsp; In 
	addition, the “especially of those who believe” clause is <em>especially</em>
    interesting. This suggests that, although Jesus saves all people, believers
    get a special benefit of some sort. I believe that this is referring to our
    sanctification, freedom from bondage to sin, ability to serve and please
    God, peace that surpasses understanding, spiritual gifts and so on, that
    are discussed throughout Scripture. We are saved from sin and given new
    life already and don’t have to wait until after we are judged!
</p>

<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+12%3A32&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        John 12:32
    </a>(ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
And I, when I am lifted up from the earth,    <strong>will draw all people to myself</strong>.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Being “lifted up from the earth” is a reference to the
    crucifixion, but may also be referencing His ascension into heaven and 
	exaltation above all else.&nbsp; Notice
    that He draws <em>all</em> people. The Greek term translated “draw” is
    ἑλκύσω (<em>elkusō</em>) which means “to drag” according to the NASB lexicon (you
    can see it here for yourself:
    <a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/john/12-32.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/lexicon/john/12-32.htm
    </a>
    ).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
    The word "drag," however does not fully capture the essence of the word as 
	it seems to imply unwillingness on the part of those being dragged.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1670.htm">HELPS Word Studies</a> clarifies that <em>elkusō</em> means to "induce (draw in), focusing on the <em>attraction-power</em> involved with the drawing."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1670.htm">Thayer's Greek Lexicon</a> also paraphrases the meaning of Jesus' statement in John 12:32 like 
	this:"I by my moral, my spiritual, influence will win over to myself the hearts of all."&nbsp; 
	This drawing is not forcing; all people will ultimately freely choose 
	Christ, being persuaded by His awesome greatness and love. You may recall from other verses that the LORD seeks us and that 
	salvation is not of ourselves, so that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).&nbsp; 
	Christ doesn't only draw us who profess belief by his grace <em>presently</em>, but also <em>
	all people.</em></p>

<h3>
    Romans 3:22b-24 (NIV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, for <strong>all have sinned</strong> and
fall short of the glory of God, and <strong>all are justified freely by his grace</strong> through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
</blockquote>
<p>
     Notice that he is including Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) in his
    argument (i.e. everybody, because you’re either a Jew or you’re not). Also,
    notice that Paul is making an argument and showing that in the same sense
    that “all have sinned”, “all are justified freely by his grace.”&nbsp; We know
    that Paul is saying that <em>everyone</em> has sinned; there is no good
    reason to assume that he means anything else than <em>everyone</em> is
    justified freely by God’s grace.&nbsp; We see in context that this 
	 justification is to be received by faith, but this does not restrict when 
	 people can come to faith (trust) in Christ.&nbsp; In fact, as we shall soon 
	 see, we are guaranteed that all people will indeed come to faith in Christ 
	 (if you don't know what I'm referring to, read on).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A18&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Romans 5:18
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of
    righteousness leads to <strong>justification and life for all men.</strong>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A22&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 Corinthians 15:22
    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
For as in Adam all die, so    <strong>also in Christ shall all be made alive</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Both Romans 5:18 and 1 Corinthians 15:22 are comparing how sin entered
    humanity with Adam causing all to be sinful, to the work of Christ by which
    all are justified and made alive. Aren’t we all sinners?&nbsp; Isn't it 
	clear that we are <em>all </em>dead in our trespasses as human beings 
	(children of Adam)?&nbsp; Again, there is no
    reason to change the “all” to mean something else. It plainly says “all.”
    Enough said.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A32&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Romans 11:32
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may    <strong>have mercy on all</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    All of Romans 11 is quite beautiful on the subject actually!&nbsp; Again, we see
    God’s heart and purpose.&nbsp; He even allows us to disobey by our own free will.
    Why? The Bible tells us: so that He can show mercy to everyone! God even
    uses our bad choices to show his merciful character.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3%3A6&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Luke 3:6
    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    And <strong>all flesh shall see the salvation of God</strong>.’”
</blockquote>
<p><em>All</em> flesh.&nbsp; Saying that this means anything less than <em>all</em> 
is unfounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying that it means that all flesh will see the 
salvation of God, but that this salvation will be kept out of reach is 
inconsistent with God's grace, mercy, love and purpose that all be saved.&nbsp;   </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h2>The Savior of the World</h2>

<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A29&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        John 1:29
    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of
    God, who takes away the <strong>sin of the world!</strong>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A14&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 John 4:14
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be    <strong>the Savior of the world.</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that he is the <em>Savior of the world</em> who takes away the sin <em>of the world</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Greek world used is <em>kosmou (</em>κόσμου) which comes from the word 
kosmos.&nbsp; According to Strong's concordance 
(http://biblehub.com/greek/2889.htm) this can mean the world, the inhabitants of 
the world, or even the <em>universe</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it is the word 
from which we derive the English words <em>cosmos </em>and <em>cosmology</em> which refer 
to the universe.&nbsp; Clearly, this is <em>not</em> a word that narrows the 
scope of Christ's salvation!&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, it broadens it and denotes the 
salvation of all people.&nbsp; </p>

        1 John 2:2
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and <strong>not only for ours but also
    for the sins of the whole world. </strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
    1 John 2:2 is perhaps the most remarkable of them all. We know John is
    speaking to believers in his letter. Notice that he makes it a clear point
to tell his readers that Jesus is the atoning sacrifice<em> not only for us, </em>but also for the sins of the    <em>whole world.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Notice that he says the <em>whole </em>world, in case just saying <em>the 
	world</em> wasn't enough.&nbsp; This is for emphasis, almost as if John 
	anticipated that people would attempt to reduce the gospel to something 
	smaller than it was meant to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, says John, Jesus really did 
	pay for the sins of the entire world!</p>
<h2>Cryptic Passages Make Sense</h2>
<h3>
    1 Peter 3:18-22 (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
   
    For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to
God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah,
    while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons,
    were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds
    to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an
    appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus
    Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of
    God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.

    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A6&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 Peter 4:6
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that
    though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the
    spirit the way God does.
</blockquote>
<p>
     These last two passages from 1 Peter are quite amazing. In 1
Peter 3, we see the great mercy of Christ in that he visited the    <em>disobedient</em> men from the days of Noah and proclaimed something to
    them (presumably the gospel). Recall that God judged mankind at that time
    for incredible wickedness which was so great that “every inclination of the
    thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time” (Genesis 6:5). Yet
    Christ preached to them, and 1 Peter 4:6 tells us why: that “they might
    live in the spirit the way God does.”

<p>
    Almost all of these verses 
	(except perhaps the last two passages from 1 Peter) are extremely straightforward and direct. The
    language isn’t symbolic or figurative. The meaning is obvious. The only
    objection that can arise in our minds is “what about hell?” If you remove
    this bias from the reading, however, the verses are entirely clear. We will
    address the “what about hell?” question later, and I think you’ll see that
    these direct, easy to understand verses mean what they say, while the
    traditional doctrine of hell has very little biblical support at all. By
    the way, feel free to skip ahead if this is still a stumbling block to you.
    Then come back and see the awesomeness of God’s plan in saving the whole
    world, as the Bible plainly teaches!

<blockquote>
On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for    <strong>all peoples</strong> a feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged
    wine, of rich food full of marrow, of aged wine well refined. And he will
swallow up on this mountain the covering that is cast over    <strong>all peoples</strong>, the veil that is spread over all nations. He
will swallow up death forever; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from    <strong>all faces</strong>, and

<h3>Isaiah 49:6</h3>
<blockquote class="center">
    He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant <br>To raise up
    the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; <br>

<h3>Daniel 7:13-14</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "I kept looking in the night visions, <br>And behold, with the clouds of
        heaven<br>One like a Son of Man was coming, <br>And He came up to the Ancient
        of Days <br>And was presented before Him.

        "And to Him was given dominion, <br>Glory and a kingdom, 
		<br>That <strong>all the
        peoples, nations and men of every language <br>Might serve Him.</strong><br>His dominion
        is an everlasting dominion <br>Which will not pass away; <br>And His kingdom is
        one <br>Which will not be destroyed."
    </blockquote>

<p>In the Old Testament as well we see God's heart for all peoples. 
Interestingly, the religious leaders of Jesus' day had forgotten this, assuming 
that they alone were God's chosen people. They called the Gentiles "dogs" and 
refused to associate with them at all. Yet God was clear that his redemptive 
plan was broader than they were willing to admit. Let's not make the same 
mistake now and limit God's grace as if it only applies to the few. </p>
	<h2>The Redemption of All Things</h2>

<p>
    It is interesting to note that God doesn’t just focus on the redemption of
    mankind but also on the redemption of all of creation. The following verses
    focus on the redemption of <strong>all</strong> things under Christ. How
    could humanity, who was made in His image, not be a part of this redemptive
    plan?

    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight
	<strong>making known to us the mystery of his will</strong>, <strong>according to his purpose</strong>, which he set forth in Christ
	<strong>as a plan for the fullness of time</strong>, to unite<strong> all things in him, things in

    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    When <strong>all things are subjected to him</strong>, then the Son himself will also be
    subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may

        Colossians 1:19-20
    </a>
    (ESV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through
    him to <strong>reconcile to himself all things</strong>, <strong>whether on earth or in heaven</strong>,
    making peace by the blood of his cross.
</blockquote>
<p>
    There you have it!&nbsp; All things reconciled, united, and subjected to 
	Christ.&nbsp; This is God's will, purpose, and plan that He has revealed to 
	us (as Ephesians 1:7-10 so eloquently says).&nbsp; In what possible sense could this be true if billions of 
	people, made in His image, remain rebellious and unredeemed eternally?</p>
	<p>
    You may be thinking to yourself: “This guy is just copying text from the
    Bible! This is practically plagiarism! How can he even say he wrote this
    argument when it’s just a bunch of Bible verses!”
</p>
<p>
    Well said, hypothetical critic. Well said.
</p>
<p>
    The fact of the matter is that little commentary is necessary since the
    concept that all people are saved is very well established biblically. Why
    then do we have such a hard time accepting it? The answer largely lies in
    our doctrine of hell as a place of eternal torment. Doesn’t the Bible
    support this view as well? Aren’t they contradictory? How is this possible?
    In the next section (Is the Doctrine of hell Biblical?), we will examine
    these questions. But before we do so, let’s continue to look at the
    Biblical evidence and arguments in support of salvation for all.
