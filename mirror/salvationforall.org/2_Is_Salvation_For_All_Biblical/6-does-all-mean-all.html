<h1>
    Does All Really Mean All?
</h1>
<p>
    Often, those who wish to cast doubt on the view that God will save all
    people will claim that the biblical passages that refer to the salvation of
    all people only refer to “all types” or “all groups” of people. The most
    immediately obvious problem with such a claim is that the passages do not
    actually say “all types of people,” but instead say “all people.”
    Certainly, the authors could have made it clear that they were referring
    only to a select few representatives of each group, if that was actually
    what they meant. But they did not, because that is not what they meant.
    Let’s look at a few verses and take them for what they actually say,
    assuming that the biblical writers were competent and precise in their use
    of language, rather than assuming they meant to say something else.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 4:10-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the
    living God, who is the <strong>Savior of all people</strong>, especially of
    those who believe. Command and teach these things.
</blockquote>
<p>
    There is no evidence that Paul means “all types of people” in this passage.
    The phrase “Savior of all people” is “<a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/so_te_r_4990.htm"
        title="Sōtēr: Preserver"
    ><em>Sōtēr</em>
    </a>
    <em> </em>
    <a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/panto_n_3956.htm"
        title="pantōn: of all (severally)"
    >
        <em>pantōn</em>
    </a>
    <em> </em>
    <a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/anthro_po_n_444.htm"
        title="anthrōpōn: men"
    >
        <em>anthrōpōn</em></a>” (Σωτὴρ πάντων ἀνθρώπων). It is rightly translated as the “Savior of all
    people” or the “Savior of all mankind” and there is no indication that it
    is only referring to some members of specific groups. In fact, the verse
    itself contradicts such a notion because it says He is the “Savior of all
    people, <em>especially</em> of those who believe.” This undeniably confirms
    that Paul is speaking of God as the Savior of both believers and
    unbelievers when he says “all people.” Especially means in a special sense,
    not exclusively. This clearly refers to the fact that believers are
    experiencing the reality of God’s reconciliation and sanctification from
    sin presently, and that we will receive promises as heirs to the kingdom.
    As Romans 8:17 states, “now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of
    God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order
    that we may also share in his glory.” It is clear that one of the special
    benefits of believing in Christ is the reward of reigning with Him.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Timothy 2:10-13
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The saying is trustworthy, for:
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
    <br/>
    if we endure, we will also <strong>reign with him</strong>;
    <br/>
    if we deny him, he also will deny us;
    <br/>
    <strong>if we are faithless, he remains faithful—</strong>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>for he cannot deny himself.</strong>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 20:4-6
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of
    Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or
    its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands.
    They came to life and <strong>reigned with Christ</strong> for a thousand
    years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years
    were ended. This is the <strong>first resurrection</strong>.
    <strong>
        Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection
    </strong>
    !
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Trusting in Christ allows us to “die with Him” so that we can “live with
    Him,” and to endure so that we can “reign with Him.” This is certainly one
    key reason why He is the Savior of both believers and unbelievers, but
    especially of believers. Those who believe are the elect, not in the sense
    of being the only ones to experience salvation, but in the sense of being
    chosen to reign with Christ and bring others into His kingdom. Believers
    are meant to be leaders that point others to God, and therefore serve a
    special role in God’s plan of redemption. As believers who endure, we will
    also experience the first resurrection (a special benefit), making us
    blessed and holy.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to notice that the basis for our blessing in Christ is
    not the result of our good works and faithfulness, but rather because of
    His faithfulness. Notice that “if we are faithless, he remains faithful—for
    he cannot deny himself.” It is in God’s very nature to be faithful, even to
    those who are not faithful to him. It is central to His character. Although
    He may deny us our places as rulers in His kingdom if we deny Him, He will
    remain faithful to all because that is who He is, the Savior of all people,
    even the faithless, rebellious, and unbelieving. Our salvation rests
    entirely on His love and grace, and we can trust that He will be true to
    His promises to save.
</p>
<h4>
    Jews and Gentiles
</h4>
<p>
    Now, some would argue that certain passages that discuss the redemption of
    all people are referring to two types of people as groups: Jews and
    Gentiles. In other words, they will say that God doesn’t save all
    individuals, but rather only some individuals of both groups. While there
    is much discussion of Jews and Gentiles in the Bible, this does not change
    the fact that “all” refers to the individual members of these groups if the
    grammar is understood correctly. We will see why shortly, but let’s first
    take a look at some of the verses that opponents try to discount.
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 3:23-25a (ESV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For there is no distinction: for
    <strong>
        all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
        by his grace as a gift</strong>, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, <sup> </sup>whom God put
    forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.
	</blockquote>
<p>
In some versions, the “all” is repeated so that it states “for<strong> all</strong> have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and    <strong>all</strong> are justified freely by his grace through the
    redemption that came by Christ Jesus” (NIV). In the original Greek, the
    word translated as “all” is <em>pantes</em>, and it only occurs once. Now,
    some will attempt to say that this therefore means that only some are
    justified freely, but this betrays a lack of understanding of grammar. The
    reason why “all” is used only once is because both clauses are referring
    back to the same “all” as their subject. The same “all” that have sinned is
    the “all” that are freely justified. In other words, if you insist Romans
    3:23 means that everybody has sinned, you are grammatically and logically
    bound to admit that everybody is freely justified by his grace as a gift.
    It is rather curious that virtually every tract that is used to convince
    people that they are sinners omits the good news that they are freely
    justified by Christ (even though this clause is part of the same sentence
    and uses the same subject). How can it be argued that such a presentation
    is not a distortion of the gospel message Paul is presenting?
</p>
<p>
    The passage is clear that the “all” who have sinned, are the same “all” who
    are justified. This is one primary reason why people who wish to hold to
    the doctrine of eternal conscious torment then argue that “all” actually
    means just “some” from “all” groups (i.e. Jews and Gentiles). This same
    misguided reasoning is used to discount the following verse:
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    <u>
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A32&amp;version=ESV"
        >
            Romans 11:32
        </a>
        (ESV)
    </u>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may    <strong>have mercy on all</strong>.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    To be sure, Paul is discussing Jews and Gentiles in both Romans 3 and
    Romans 11, but it is worth noting that all people fall into one of those
    two categories (Gentile simply means not Jewish). It is grammatically
    clear, however, that he is speaking of individuals (not of groups), when he
    says “all.” This is clear because in Greek “adjectives always agree in
case, gender, and <strong>number</strong> with the noun they modify” (<a href="https://greeklinguistics.com/grammar/06.html">Palmer</a>). This is
    a grammar rule. If Paul were referring to Jews and Gentiles as groups, he
    should have used the adjective “both” rather than “all.” This can be
    illustrated rather simply.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following examples:
</p>
<p>
    1. “There are two teams, each with ten players. They <em>both</em> went out
    to pizza after the game.”
</p>
<p>
    Who is being referred to in this sentence by the word <em>both</em>?
</p>
<p>
    It is clearly referring to both teams. In such a case it is not mandatory
    that all of the individuals from both teams went to pizza, though we would
    generally assume that most or all were present. But in this sentence we
know that he is referring to the <em>two teams</em> because the word    <em>both</em> is used when we want to denote two of something, and there
    are two teams.
</p>
<p>
    Now consider the following example:
</p>
<p>
    2. “There are two teams, each with ten players. They <em>all</em> went out
    to pizza after the game.”
</p>
<p>
    Who is being referred to in this sentence by the word <em>all</em>?
</p>
<p>
    It is clearly referring to all of the individual players on the teams. It
    does not refer to “all” of the teams because there are only two teams.
    Saying that “all” means “some of the players from all of the teams” is
    simply incorrect and distorts the plain meaning of the sentence. “All”
    means all of the players that comprise the teams.
</p>
<p>
    In the same way, when Paul is speaking of two groups (Jews and Gentiles),
    but then says that “all” are justified and that mercy is shown to “all,” he
    is referring to all of the members of those two groups of people (i.e.
    everybody on earth). If he wanted to refer to the two groups generically,
    he should have said “<em>both</em> are freely justified” and that “God
    consigned <em>both</em> to disobedience, that he may<strong> </strong>
        have mercy on <em>both</em>.” But he didn’t because he didn’t want to.
    </p>
<p>
        In case the concept that the word “both” should be used when referring
        to two nouns is still unclear, let’s look at one more example to show
        this to be the case:
    </p>
<p>
        “There were two kids. They <em>all</em> went to the store.”
    </p>
<p>
        Does that sound right to you? It shouldn’t. The word “all” implies more
        than two, so it sound like there must be more than two kids being
        discussed. Since we are only discussing two kids, however, we would
        rightly say that “both” went to the store.
    </p>
<p>
        Now, it is an established rule of Greek grammar that adjectives must
        agree in number with the nouns they modify. It might, however, be
        asserted that perhaps there is no word for “both” in Greek, so Paul had
        to use “all.” But this is false. Greek does have a word for “both” and
        it is used in the Bible appropriately when describing two nouns. The
        word is<strong>
        </strong>
    <em>amphoteroi<strong> </strong></em>
    (ἀμφότεροι) and you can see it used in the Bible in multiple instances to
    mean “both” here:
    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/amphoteroi_297.htm">
        Englishman’s Concordance
    </a>
    . At this same resource there are several other inflections (forms) of the
    word as well that are shown to the right. So, it is quite clear that the
    Biblical writers were familiar with the word “both” and that they knew how
    to use it when they wanted to denote two groups. Paul himself uses it
    multiple times in the following passage to denote two groups, so he clearly
    knew the word and its meaning:
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 2:13-18
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by
the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace, who has made us both (<em>amphotera/</em>ἀμφότερα) one and has broken down in his flesh the
    dividing wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments expressed
    in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the
    two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both (<em>amphoterous</em>
    /ἀμφοτέρους) to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the
    hostility. And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace
    to those who were near. For through him we both (<em>amphoteroi</em>
    /ἀμφότεροι) have access in one Spirit to the Father.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here Paul is clearly referring to the two groups (Jews and Gentiles) being
    made into one body of believers. In context, those who were “far off” were
    the Gentiles and those who “were near” were the Jews. Now, in this context
    it is not mandatory that Paul be referring to all individuals that make up
    these two groups. Conversely, it is not mandatory that he is referring to
    only some members of each group either. He is referring to two groups of
    people and it is simply not clear how many members of each group he is
    referring to. So, both Jews and Gentiles can be united in Christ and all
    hostility between these groups should be abolished due to the cross. Peace
    was preached to both groups.
</p>
<p>
    But in verses like Romans 3:23-25 and Romans 11:32 that we discussed above,
    he doesn’t refer to both groups but rather to “all.” When he says that “all
    have sinned,” he is clearly making the claim that every person has sinned,
    whether Jew or Gentile. If you agree with this, then you logically must
    admit that every person is “justified by his grace as a gift.” If you agree
    that all people have been disobedient to God, you must admit that the
    purpose of this disobedience is so that God could “have mercy on all” of
    those who have been disobedient.
</p>
<p>
    And it must be admitted, if we read the biblical texts honestly (without
    the bias that eternal damnation is foundational), that the biblical writers
    make it extremely clear that Jesus’ atoning sacrifice paid for the sins of
    the entire world. Notice again that Romans 3 says that all “are justified
by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,<sup> </sup>    <strong>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood.”&nbsp; </strong>This
    same language is used in the following verse, and it is undeniable that this propitiation (atoning sacrifice) is for everyone:
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 2:2
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<strong><sup> </sup></strong>
He is the <strong>propitiation</strong> for our sins, and    <strong>not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world</strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Therefore, if we believe that there is consistency in the biblical message,
    it is clear that when Paul refers to “all” sinning and being freely
    justified by the redemptive propitiation of Christ, that he is in agreement
    with John and is referring to the whole world. Christ’s atoning sacrifice
    truly paid for the sins of every single person.
</p>
<p>
This is why 1 Timothy 2:6 states that Christ “gave himself as a    <strong>ransom</strong><strong> for all</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
    It is why John 4:42 and 1 John 4:14 refer to Jesus as the “Savior of the
    world” and why 1 Timothy 4:10 refers to Him as the “Savior of all people.”
</p>
<p>
It is also why Jesus Himself stated that His purpose was “to    <strong>save</strong> the world” (John 12:47, see also John 3:17), and why
    Paul claims that God’s purpose was to “unite all things” in Christ and
    “reconcile to himself all things” through Him (Ephesians 1:10 and
    Colossians 1:20).
</p>
<p>
    The fact that such claims are made repeatedly in many different books of
    the Bible is a good clue that we should take them seriously. Perhaps the
    biblical writers actually meant what they said. This is certainly a thought
    that is at least worth considering!
</p>
<h4>
    All People are Clearly Being Discussed
</h4>
<p>
    Furthermore, it is plain from many other passages that the biblical authors
    are discussing the entirety of humanity. Consider for example, the
    following verse that is comparing the entrance of sin and condemnation into
    humanity by Adam to the justification and life brought by Christ.
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    <u>
        <a

        >
            Romans 5:18
        </a>
    </u>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of
    righteousness leads to <strong>justification and life for all men.</strong>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    
   
        This verse is making a very 
		clear, straightforward claim that Christ’s
        act of righteousness (his atoning sacrifice and resurrection) results
        in “justification and life for all men.” Just as Adam’s failure led to
        condemnation for everyone, Christ’s act of love leads to justification
        and life for everyone. If we assert that all are condemned, we must be
        honest and assert that all will by justified and given life in Christ.
        Paul makes this very apparent. And if we look at the context of this
        verse, he doesn’t just equate Adam’s sin to Christ’s redemption, but
        rather makes it abundantly clear that Christ’s work is far greater in
        its power to save than Adam’s failure ever was for condemnation:
    </p>
<h3>
    <strong>Romans 5:15-21</strong>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<strong><sup> </sup></strong>
    But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one
    man's trespass, <strong>much more</strong> have the grace of God and the
    free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. And
    the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the
    judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift
    following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one
man's trespass, death reigned through that one man,    <strong>much more</strong> will those who receive the abundance of grace
    and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus
    Christ.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>
        Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act
        of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.
    </strong>
    For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the
    one man's obedience the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to
increase the trespass, but where sin increased,    <strong>grace abounded all the more</strong>, so that, as sin reigned in
    death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life
    through Jesus Christ our Lord.
	</blockquote>
<p>
        There are several very important observations that must be made if we
        read this passage carefully. First, it must be noted that the free gift
        of God’s grace has abounded “<em>much more</em>” than the results of
        Adam’s trespass. His grace is far greater! In fact, we see that the
        increase of sin results in a <em>superior</em> increase in God’s grace,
        for as “sin increased, <em>grace abounded all the more</em>.” The
        results of mankind’s disobedience are no match for the power of God’s
        boundless grace! There is no contest: His grace wins!
    </p>
<p>
    A second important observation from this passage is that Paul is equating
the “many” to “all.” He has clarified that the many that were made sinners    <em>are </em>the many that will be made righteous, and that when he says
    “many” he is referring to “all men.” It is undeniable that Paul is doing
    this because he is making the claim that the <em>many</em> were made
    sinners. None of us are sinless wonders. Not a single person on earth. We
    have all sinned, but thank God that His grace and mercy are far more
    powerful than our weaknesses and rebellion.
</p>
<p>
    Some may attempt to argue that his use of the term “many” means that he is
    not actually referring to “all” men, but this is nonsense. All of humanity
    is <em>very many</em> people. It is obvious that you can refer to all of
    humanity as “many” people. You cannot, however, say that “many” is a
    restrictive term that negates Paul’s claim that Christ’s “act of
    righteousness leads to justification and life for <em>all</em> men” because
    it doesn’t. “Many” has no cap, no upper limit.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s make this clear. Imagine that the total population of humans that
    have lived on earth is 100 billion people. Does that qualify as many?&nbsp; Of
    course it does.&nbsp;&nbsp; What if many more billions of people live on 
	earth as human history continues?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would this cease to be many 
	people?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Many has no upper limit.</p>
	<p>
    &nbsp;What if, however, only ten percent of these people receive
    justification and life? Can Paul rightly claim that Christ’s sacrifice
    “leads to justification and life for <em>all men</em>?” Of course not! Ten
    percent is not all men! It is only a small fraction of men. Likewise, it is
    apparent that the word “many” does not modify the word “all” so that it
    means “less than all.” Instead, the word “all” clarifies what is meant by
    the word “many.” When Paul says that many were made sinners, he is claiming
    that all were made sinners. When he says that many <em>will be</em> made
    righteous, he means that all will be made righteous. We may not be
    righteous yet, but we <em>will be</em>. God isn’t done with us yet. All of
    us comprise the multitude that is undergoing the process of transformation
    from sinful to righteous, albeit not all at the same rate or same time.
</p>
<p>
    This is why Titus 2:11-12 says that “the grace of God has appeared,
bringing <strong>salvation for all people</strong>,    <strong><sup> </sup></strong>training <strong>us </strong>to renounce
    ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and
    godly lives in the present age...” God’s grace is saving all people and
training all of us. Notice that this is an ongoing process. God is    <em>bringing </em>salvation and <em>training</em> us. But, as any teacher
    or coach knows, people don’t all learn at the same rate. Some people learn
    very slowly, but the process will continue until all people experience His
    salvation, even if this must occur through judgment after death. God does
    not give up on His children. His love never ends.
</p>
<p>
    The comprehensive nature of God’s saving grace is also attested to by the
    following verses.
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    <u>
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A22&amp;version=ESV"
        >
            1 Corinthians 15:20-22
        </a>
        (ESV)
    </u>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those
    who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also
    the resurrection of the dead. For <strong>as in Adam all die</strong>, so
    also <strong>in Christ shall all be made alive</strong>.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Once again we see that Paul is clearly claiming that all people will be
    made alive in Christ, just as all people die in Adam. By connecting Adam to
    Christ in this way, he is undoubtedly referring to all people. The same
    “all” that die in Adam are made alive in Christ.
</p>
<p>
Now, some will attempt to argue that the second clause only means “all    <em>who are in</em> Christ” will be made alive. But this is a
    misunderstanding of the plain meaning of the verse. It does not say, all
“who are” in Christ will be made alive, but rather that “in Christ    <strong>shall all </strong>be made alive.” Christ is the means by which all
    shall be made alive, for all will be made alive in Him.&nbsp; Just as Adam’s
    sinful nature was imputed to us through no fault of our own, Christ’s life
    will also be imputed to us through no work of our own.&nbsp; His life is a free
    gift.&nbsp; Christ’s work of love completely overrides the power of death and
    defeats it. This is why 1 Corinthians 15:54 says that “death is swallowed
    up in victory” and that it is "the last enemy to be destroyed" (1 
Corinthians 15:26).&nbsp; Christ is completely victorious over death and leaves no
    one in it.&nbsp; Instead he fulfills His stated mission “to save the world” (John
    12:47). All will be made alive in Christ! The Bible guarantees it!
</p>
<p>
    Why then do we doubt this truth so much? Could it be that we have fallen
    prey to the same trap of religiosity and tradition that snared the
    religious leaders at the time of Christ? Are we so married to theology,
    that we, like the Sadducees, refuse to believe that God is able to bring
    the dead to life? This is how Jesus answered them in Matthew 22:29: “You
    are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.”
    Has tradition blinded us to the truth of God’s amazing plan to redeem all
    of Creation? Is he powerful enough to accomplish His will to bring all to
    repentance, to make those dead in sin alive in Him? I believe that the
    Scriptures are clear that He has the power and desire to truly be the
    Savior of the world. For this reason, we can put our faith in Him without
    reservation.
</p>
	<h4>The Faith Condition</h4>
	<p>Yet, even with all of this scriptual evidence, there is one thing that 
	tends to confuse many people.&nbsp; Namely, it is that in some verses, faith 
	(or belief) seems to be necessary in order to be saved.&nbsp; Indeed, it is necessary to have 
	faith and trust in Christ in order to experience His salvation.&nbsp; For 
	example, in Romans 3:25, it says that the grace and redemption that is in 
	Christ is "to be received by faith."&nbsp; 
	But there is nowhere in the Bible that states that faith has an expiration 
	date.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>Instead, we have a great deal of biblical evidence that God's love and 
	pursuit of humanity will not end.&nbsp; We see that Christ has the keys to 
	death and Hades (Revelation 1:18), and that nothing can separate us from the 
	love of God, not even death (Romans 8:37-39).&nbsp; We see that God swears 
	by Himself that every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus 
	Christ is Lord, to His glory (Isaiah 45:22-24, Philippians 2:9-11, Romans 
	14:11).&nbsp; We are assured that God wills to save all people, that He is 
	able to accomplish anything, that He will reconcile and unite all in Christ, 
	and that His salvation will reach to the ends of the earth (too many Bible 
	verses to cite here!).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>It is prophesied that "every creature in heaven and on earth and under 
	the earth and in the sea" will worship Christ (Revelation 5:13) and that the 
	gates to the New Jerusalem are never shut (Revelation 21:25).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Instead, <em>after the judgment </em>of the lake of fire has taken place 
	Christ states that He is "<em>making</em> all things new"<em> (</em>Revelation 
	21:5). <em>&nbsp;</em>Redemption is an ongoing process.&nbsp; He is <em>
	making </em>all new, even <em>after</em> judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; And <em>after</em> 
	this we see this process continue as Christ and the church beckon those 
	outside the city to come and take the "water of life" (Revelation 22:17).</p>
	<p>God's love does not end.&nbsp; His purpose will not fail.&nbsp; All will 
	believe and trust in Christ for salvation, as God swears.&nbsp; Do we have 
	the faith to take Him at His word? </p>
