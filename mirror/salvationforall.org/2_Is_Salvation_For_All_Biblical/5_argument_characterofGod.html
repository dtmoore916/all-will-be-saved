<h1>Argument From God's Character</h1>
	<p>Another significant argument for the salvation of all people comes from 
	the character of God, as described by the Bible.&nbsp; We can see from the 
	verses below that His character does not change, but rather is consistent 
	and reliable.&nbsp; </p>
	 <h3>Malachi 3:6</h3>
	<blockquote>For I, the LORD, <strong>do not change</strong>; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not 
	consumed.
	</blockquote>

<h3>
    Psalm 33:11</h3>
	<blockquote>
    The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His heart from
    generation to generation.
</blockquote>
	<p>
    Jesus is "the 
	same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8 NIV) and 
	God the Father "<strong>does not change</strong> like shifting shadows" 
	(James 1:17 NIV).&nbsp;&nbsp;  
</p>
	<p>
    Therefore, we can look at His character, as 
	described in the Bible, and reasonably examine doctrinal claims to determine 
	if they are consistent with His character.&nbsp; If they are not, we need to 
	carefully examine these doctrinal claims.&nbsp; 
</p>
	<p>
    With this in mind, let's now examine the view that God will indeed save all 
	people and restore all things under his Lordship.</p>
<h2>God is Merciful and Compassionate</h2>	
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3%3A31-33&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Lamentations 3:31-33
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For the Lord <strong>will not cast off forever</strong>, but, though he cause grief, he will
    have <strong>compassion</strong> according to<strong> the abundance of his steadfast love</strong>; for 
	<strong>he
    does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men</strong>.
</blockquote>
This passage clearly shows God's heart for humanity and indicates his great compassion and love for us.  Though he may cause us grief via discipline, this is shown to be temporary and followed by compassion. 
<h3>
   
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A36&amp;version=ESV"
        >
            Luke 6:36
        </a>
     
</h3>
<blockquote>
Be <strong>merciful</strong>, even as your Father is    <strong>merciful</strong>.
</blockquote>
Obviously, this verse implies that God is very merciful, and asks us to be merciful <em>like Him.</em>
<h3>Exodus 34:7</h3>
<blockquote>  
    The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God
    <strong>merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and
    faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for
    thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin</strong>, but who will by no means
    clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and
    the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.”
</blockquote>	
This passage again expounds on the mercy, grace, love, patience, 
	and forgiveness of God, but requires a bit more commentary.   Notice that I included the last part of the verse that states that God will by no means clear the guilty, so that we could see the entire context.&nbsp; 
	Also, notice that the extent to which God will visit "the iniquity of the 
	fathers on the children and the children's children" is<em> only</em> "to 
	the third and fourth generation," not eternally.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is 
	clearly not referring to everlasting judgment in hell, but rather to the 
	consequences of sin on earth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't we see this reality every 
	day?&nbsp; The effects of the sins of parents are passed on to the children 
	and do affect future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp; An alcoholic father often has 
	an alcoholic son.&nbsp;&nbsp; The abused tend to be abusive or broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This does not have to be the case because we see God's great mercy break 
	through cycles of generational sin all the time, but the natural consequence 
	of sinful lifestyles frequently does affect future generations.&nbsp; 
	Fortunately, as James 2:13 tells us "mercy triumphs over judgment."  

<h3>
    Ephesians 2:1-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed
    the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the
spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one
    time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature
    deserving of wrath. But because of his <strong>great
    love</strong> for us, God, who is <strong>rich in mercy</strong>, <strong>made
    us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions</strong>—it is by
    grace you have been saved.  And God raised us
    up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ
    Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he
    might show <strong>the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness</strong>
    to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you
    have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is 
	<strong>the
    gift of God</strong>— not by works, so that no one can
    boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created
    in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to
    do.
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the kindness and "<em>incomparable </em>riches of his grace."&nbsp; 
Also, notice that this was all extended to us while we were still sinners as a 
free gift!&nbsp; </p>

            <blockquote>

                <br>

                    </blockquote>
    <p>We see again and again throughout Scripture that God is merciful, gracious, patient and loving.   These traits are clearly central to who He is 
	and clearly compatible with his purpose of salvation for all!</p>

    <blockquote>
        For <strong>his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime</strong>.
        Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.
    </blockquote>
  <h3>
    Micah 7:18-19 (NIV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Who is a God like you,
    <br/>
    who <strong>pardons sin and forgives the transgression </strong>
    <br/>
    of the remnant of his inheritance?
    <br/>
    You <strong>do not stay angry forever
    <br/>
    but delight to show mercy</strong>.
    <br/>
    You will again have <strong>compassion</strong> on us;
    <br/>
    <strong>you will tread our sins underfoot     <br/>
    and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea</strong>.
</blockquote>            He <em>delights</em> to show mercy and does NOT stay angry forever!&nbsp; Doesn't this verse speak to God's character, 
	by telling us what he delights in?&nbsp; How could a doctrine of endless, 
	merciless suffering fit in with this picture?&nbsp; Ultimate salvation of 
	all people from our sins, however, clearly <em>does</em>.&nbsp;

      <p> In all of these verses, we can see that God is good, that we can trust Him, and that he will accomplish his purpose.</p>
                    <h2>The Forgiveness of God</h2>    
                    <p>Although this character trait of God is alluded to in 
					virtually all of the passages above, it merits further 
					discussion for the purpose of understanding His character.&nbsp; 
					Let's look at just a few verses. </p>  
                    <h3>Daniel 9:9 (NIV)</h3> 
                
                    <blockquote>The Lord our God is <b>merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him;</b></blockquote>
               <h3>Colossians 3:13 (NIV) </h3>     
                    <blockquote>
    Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance
    against someone. <strong>Forgive as the Lord forgave you. </strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that God forgives us even though we have been rebellious (and we have 
<em>all</em> been rebellious).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also important to see that we 
too are called to forgive others in the same way that God has forgiven us.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</p>
	<p>This begs the question: in what way has He forgiven us?&nbsp; </p>
	<p>We can see a powerful image of this forgiveness as Jesus hung on the 
	cross, having been completely rejected, spit on, mocked, and tortured, yet
	saying “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what 
	they are doing” (Luke 23:34).</p>
	<p>Are we to believe that this same Jesus who loved his murderers so much 
	that He pleaded for their forgiveness while dying an excruciating death at 
	their hands, will return and be completely unmerciful, damning billions to 
	eternal hellfire?&nbsp; Are we to believe that all of the mercy, forgiveness 
	and grace that has been spoken of throughout the Bible will cease, simply 
	because a person has died and missed their chance to repent? Think 
	about this.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Seriously, put aside any bias, and think honestly.&nbsp; What do <em>you</em> 
	conclude?</p>
                    
<h2>God is Just</h2>  

<p>I saved this character trait of God for last for several reasons, not the 
least of which is that it is a good segue to a future section that discusses the 
Biblical concept of justice.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Another reason that I waited is that I am confident that many readers 
	have been glossing over the numerous verses above, not really taking them in, 
	because they believe that I am ignoring God's justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
	eyes of many, justice is the trump card that dismantles God's mercy, and the 
	reason why hell is justifiable.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>But the Bible contradicts this notion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In James 2:13, we see 
	the exact opposite, that "mercy 
	triumphs over judgment."&nbsp; In other words, mercy is the trump card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>In fact we see that God's justice is tied to his grace and compassion.</p>
	<p>We will just examine one verse on this subject now (because an entire 
	upcoming section deals with God's justice):</p>   
                    
<h3> <a href="https://dailyverses.net/isaiah/30/18">
                                Isaiah 30:18 NIV
                                                       
                            </a>    
 </h3>
                           <blockquote>
                            Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you;
                            <br/>
                            therefore he will rise up to show you compassion.
                            <br/>
                               <strong>For the Lord is a God of justice.
                               </strong>
                            <br/>
                            Blessed are all who wait for him!
                                    </blockquote>
 <p>Notice God's <em>longing </em>to show grace and compassion.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; 
 The text tells us it is <em>because</em> He is a God of justice!&nbsp; Notice 
 that God's just character is tied inextricably to his grace and compassion.&nbsp; 
 His justice is a product of his great love, for "God is love" (1John 4:8).&nbsp; 
 In a future section, we will look in more detail at the Biblical concept of 
 justice, and see how it is entirely compatible with the salvation of all 
 people. </p>
	<p>But before we move on, consider God's character, his longings, and his 
	delights as described throughout the Bible.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Consider deeply.&nbsp; Who is God?&nbsp; What is He like?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Now consider, will this God damn the vast majority of humanity to eternal 
	suffering or save them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of these options is consistent 
	with his nature?&nbsp; Only you can decide, but I believe the choice is 
	obvious.</p>
