<h1>
    Not Yet
</h1>
<p>
    The Gospel of John begins with one of the most famous Christological
    passages found in the Bible. In it, John describes the true nature of Jesus
    as well as the universal scope of God’s salvific plan. Let’s take a look.
</p>
<h3>
    John 1:1-9 (NIV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
    God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made;
    without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that
    life was <strong>the light of all mankind</strong>. The light shines in the
    darkness, and <strong>the darkness has not overcome it</strong>.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to
testify concerning that light, so that through him    <strong>all might believe</strong>. He himself was not the light; he came
    only as a witness to the light.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		The true light that <strong>gives light to everyone</strong> was coming
    into the world.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    There are several very important things to notice in this passage.
</p>
<p>
    First, we see that Jesus is the light of <em>all mankind</em>. This means
    that He is the light for every person. There is no good reason to believe
    that it means anything less.
</p>
<p>
    Second, we see that Christ shines as light in the darkness of this world
    and that the darkness does not overcome Him. In other words, the light of
    Jesus wins and the darkness loses. His light is not overcome by the
    darkness; instead, He conquers the darkness.
</p>
<p>
    Third, we see that the purpose of the light of Christ is that <em>all</em>
    might believe. So, Christ came as a light, and John the Baptist testified
    about Him, so that every person (not just <em>some</em> people) would be
    able to believe in Him and through Him.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, John says again (in slightly different words) that Jesus really is
the light for all mankind, calling Him “the true light that gives light to    <em>everyone</em>.” So, in case you had doubts that Jesus really was the
    light for all people, John doubles down on his earlier assertion,
    presumably to make sure that his readers would understand and not
    misrepresent his words. Perhaps he needed to say it a third time so that
    people would really get it, but it seems quite apparent that John is
    meaning what he is saying in this passage: Jesus is the light of the world
    who gives light to everyone (i.e. all mankind).
</p>
<p>
    Now, at this point some people might object because the next verses say
    that “the world did not recognize him” and “his own did not receive him”
    (John 1:10-11). For this reason, people will say that the previous
    Christological statements (that Jesus is the light of all mankind that is
    not overcome by darkness, but rather who gives light to everyone so that
    everyone might believe) are null and void. You see, they will say, some
    people reject His light and are therefore doomed to eternal suffering. Not
    everyone has faith. Not everyone believes. Not everyone understands the
    light of the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    The Scriptural answer to all these objections is actually quite simple. Not
    everyone has faith <em>yet. </em>Not everyone believes <em>yet</em>. Not
    everyone understands the light of the gospel <em>yet</em>. If you read John
    1 carefully you will notice that <em>his own</em> <em>did not</em> receive
    him. First, it is important to notice that those who did not receive Him
    are <em>still His.</em> They are “His own” and they therefore belong to
    Him.
</p>
<p>
    Second it must be noted that they <em>did not</em> receive Him. This is in
the past tense. They <em>did not</em> but that does not mean that they    <em>will not</em>. There is not a single person on the planet who has, from
birth, always understood the light of the gospel. Everyone<em> did not </em>(including you), but that does not mean that they (or you)    <em>will not</em>. Instead, it is a certainty that we will see all
    ultimately subject to Him, united in Him and reconciled to God (1
    Corinthians 15, Ephesians 1, Colossians 1, 2 Corinthians 5). The book of
    Hebrews, in fact, directly tells us that we do not <em>yet</em> see the
    fullness of what Christ has done (as described in the above references).
    Let’s take a look:
</p>
<h3>
    Hebrews 2:6-9
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		It has been testified somewhere,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“What is man, that you are mindful of him,
    <br/>
    or the son of man, that you care for him?
    <br/>
    You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
    <br/>
    you have crowned him with glory and honor,
    <br/>
    putting everything in subjection under his feet.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Now in putting <strong>everything</strong> in subjection to him,<strong> he left nothing outside his control</strong>. At present, we do    <strong>not yet</strong> see everything in subjection to him. But we see
him who for a little while was made lower than the angels,    <strong>namely Jesus</strong>, crowned with glory and honor because of the
suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might    <strong>taste death for everyone</strong>.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is clear from this passage that the author of the book of Hebrews is
saying that everything is subject to Christ and under His control, but    <em>we do not see it yet</em>. Jesus has tasted death <em>for everyone</em>
    , and for this reason He has been exalted and crowned with glory and honor.
    Let’s repeat those truths again:
</p>
<p>
    1. By God’s grace, Jesus experienced death for <em>everyone</em>.
</p>
<p>
2. <em>Everything</em> is in subjection to Christ and under His control but    <em>we</em> do not <em>yet </em>see this fact.
</p>
<p>
    There is no scriptural basis to reject the universal nature of Christ’s
    atoning sacrifice. People struggle to believe this simply because we do not
    yet see the complete fulfillment of his purpose and plan. But why should we
    see this already? It is a plan and purpose for the “fullness of time”
    (Ephesians 1:10). The “fullness of time” is yet to come. We haven’t reached
    the end <em>yet</em>.&nbsp; In addition, we do not have complete knowledge or
    understanding yet.&nbsp; Instead, “for now we see in a mirror dimly” (1 Corinthians
    13:12).&nbsp; This is why it is important to have faith, which Hebrews 11:1
    describes as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
    seen.”
</p>
<p>
    We can have faith that Christ will accomplish His purpose, and this faith
    is the evidence that what we hope for will come to pass. We should put our
    hope, as Paul did, “in the living God, who is the Savior of all people” (1
    Timothy 4:10).&nbsp; This same God is our Heavenly Father who is “not willing
    that any should perish but that all should come to repentance" (2 Peter
    3:9). Shouldn’t we strive to be of the same mind and have hope for the
    fulfillment of God’s will, even though we don’t see it fulfilled in every
    soul <em>yet</em>?
</p>
<p>
    “Not yet” and “not ever” are two very different things. The Bible tells us
    that the correct interpretation of the incomplete restoration we see in the
    present world is “not yet, but someday.” Someday, all will be made right
    and every person will bow and confess that Jesus is Lord to God’s glory.
    Someday, all that is wrong in every soul will be made right. Someday,
    suffering and evil will end. Jesus’ success in His mission to save the
    world is assured.
</p>
<p>
    <em>We </em>
    just don’t see it <em>yet</em>. This understanding illuminates the
    following verses from Hebrews 2 as well.
</p>
<h3>
    Hebrews 2:14-15
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise
    partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who
    has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who
    through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The incarnation and death of Jesus not only allowed Christ to fully
    identify with the people he came to save, but also allowed him to destroy
    the devil, who has the power of death. We do not <em>yet</em> see the devil
    destroyed from our perspective, but this reality is assured. Satan no
longer has power over us because of the work of Jesus, whether this    <em>seems </em>true to us at present or not.
</p>
<p>
    It is also clear, once again, that Jesus’ saving purpose is for all people.
    Notice that He died to “deliver <em>all </em>those who through fear of
    death were subject to lifelong slavery.” I think it is universal for human
    beings to be fearful of death. This fear makes us slaves. Have you ever
    feared death? If so, you are a human being and Christ came to deliver you
    from your slavery. Do you know someone who is afraid of death? Christ died
    to free them too. It is apparent that He came to deliver all of us and
    ultimately destroy death’s power (and Satan’s power) completely. One day,
    we will see this deliverance clearly, but for now we are called to trust
    Him and believe that He will ultimately, absolutely, decisively succeed.
And we can be confident that the full redemption that we don’t see    <em>yet</em>, will come to pass in due time because the God we trust “works
    out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will” (Ephesians
    1:11).
</p>
<div class="box"><p>
    Key side note: It is important to recognize that the writer of Hebrews is
    interpreting Psalm 8 as a prophetic reference to Christ. This is why he
    clarifies that it is “namely Jesus” who was made lower than the angels for a
    little while. The reason I bring this up is that certain versions (namely
    the NIV) translates Hebrews 2:7-9 in like this:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“You made <strong>them</strong> a little lower than the angels; you crowned
    them with glory and honor and put everything under <strong>their</strong>
    feet.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In putting everything under <strong>them</strong>, God left nothing that is
    not subject to <strong>them</strong>. Yet at present we do not see
    everything subject to <strong>them</strong>. But we do see Jesus, who was
    made lower than the angels for a little while…
	</blockquote>
<p>
The words translated as “them” in the NIV are all forms of the Greek word    <em>autos</em> (αὐτός). I think this is an interpretive error in the
    translation, particularly since the author of Hebrews specifically tells us
    that He is talking about Jesus as the One who was made lower than the
    angels for a little while. It contextually makes little sense to use the
    pronoun “them” repeatedly, and then say, “by them I mean Jesus.” Such a
    translation is inconsistent and makes the passage confusing. Additionally,
    we have other Scriptural references that interpret this same Psalm and tell
    us that all is made subject to Jesus (“Him” not “them”).
</p>
<p>
    For example, 1 Corinthians 15:27-28 says,
</p>
	<blockquote>
		For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that
    “everything” has been put <strong>under him</strong>, it is clear that this
does not include God himself, who put everything    <strong>under Christ</strong>. When he has done this, then the Son himself
    will be made subject to him
    <strong>
        who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all
    </strong>
    .
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The above passage clearly makes the case that everything has been put under
    Christ and made subject to Him. The fact that the NIV chose to translate
    the references to Christ in Hebrews 2:7-9 as “them” but many other
    translations rightly translate these references as “him” is yet another
    illustration of the fact that English translations are imperfect and
    inconsistent with each other. There is always an interpretive element to
    translation, so it is important to be able to recognize this and examine
    multiple translations and the Greek as well to get the best understanding
    of the text.
