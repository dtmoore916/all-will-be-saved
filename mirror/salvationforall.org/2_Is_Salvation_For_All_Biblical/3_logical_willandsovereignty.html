<h1>Logical Argument 2: God’s Sovereignty, Will and Purpose</h1>
<p>
    We have already established some clear principles of logic. Now we will
    apply these principles again to show that God will indeed save all people.
    First, we must establish our premises.
</p>
<h2>
    Premise 1: God’s Sovereignty
</h2>

<p>
    The premise can be stated like this. If God is sovereign (i.e. in control of 
	all things), then He can and will do whatever He wills to do.
</p>
<p>
    So now we must address the concept of God being sovereign from a biblical
    standpoint to determine if it is true. Let’s examine the evidence together
    now.

    </a>
</h3>

    For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
    declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my
    ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. “For as the
    rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water
    the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and
    bread to the eater, <strong>so shall my word be</strong> that goes out from
    my mouth;
    <strong>
        it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I
        purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
    </strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
    From all of these verses, it is apparent that God is able to accomplish His
    will and that He will in fact make it happen. Whatever He wants to
    accomplish, He will succeed at it. This is abundantly clear from these
    Scriptures as well as others.
</p>
<p>
    Now we must ask what the will of God is, for we know that he will bring it
    about.
</p>
<p>
    It is unmistakable from the word of God that His will, purpose, and desire
    is the salvation of all people and the ultimate redemption of all things.
    Consider the following Scriptures.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A9&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        2 Peter 3:9
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is
    patient toward you,
    <strong>
        not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach
        repentance.
    </strong>
</blockquote>
<p>The word translated "wishing" in this Bible version is also translated "willing" in other versions.  In the Greek it is 
<em>boulomenos</em> (βουλόμενος).&nbsp; According to
<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1014.htm">HELPS Word-studies</a>,
<em>boulomenos</em> has the connotation of resolute planning and "is a strong term that underlines the predetermined (and determined) intention driving the planning (wishing, resolving)."</p>
	<div class="box">As a reminder, you can click on the underlined "HELPS Word-studies" link above to take you directly to the source of this info! Be sure to learn to use these tools so you can be a diligent student of God's Word yourself!</div>
<p>The reason I bring up the Greek is because some will argue that God is merely wishing that all will come to repentance in the same way that a person might wish upon a star, like I used to wish for the Knight Rider Power Wheel car when I was four.&nbsp; 
But this isn't the connotation of the word at all.&nbsp; Instead it denotes 
planning, purpose, and determination.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as we've seen, God's 
purposes cannot be thwarted.</p>

<blockquote>
If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for    <strong>I did not come to judge the world but to save the world</strong>.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 2:1-6
</h3>
<blockquote>
    I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and
    thanksgiving be made for all people— for kings and all those
    in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness
and holiness.  This is good, and pleases God our Savior, <strong>who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of
    the truth.</strong>  For there is one God and one mediator between God
    and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself <strong>as a
    ransom for all people</strong>. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.
</blockquote>
<p>The word translated "wants" in this passage from Timothy is <em>thelei</em> (θέλει).   This word has more semantic range than <em>boulomai</em>, connoting everything from desire to design, and sometimes means "to be resolved or determined, to purpose" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/2309.htm">Bible Hub</a>).&nbsp; Regardless of its exact connotation, the desire of God is made perfectly clear.&nbsp; 
It is reasonable, however, to interpret the word as having a similar sense to 
the <em>boulomenos</em> of 2 Peter since there is acknowledgment among scholars that 
the words <em>thelei</em> and <em>boulomai</em> "are sometimes used indiscriminately, and especially that θέλω as the less sharply-defined term is put where βούλομαι would be proper."&nbsp; 
This may be especially true considering how the Greek language has evolved since "in modern Greek θέλω seems to have nearly driven βούλομαι out of use"
(<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/2309.htm">Bible Hub, referencing other 
scholarly works</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<h3>
    John 3:16-17
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever
    believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God
    <strong>
        did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order
        that the world might be saved through him
    </strong>
    .”
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Scriptures <em>clearly</em> teach us that God desires all people to be
    saved!
</p>
<p>
    This leads us to our second premise:
</p>
<h2>
    <em>Premise 2: If God wills to save all people, then He will do it.</em>
</h2>
<p>
    It is crystal clear from the Bible that God’s desire is for the salvation
    of all mankind, therefore He will accomplish his purpose. As He said in
    Isaiah “<strong>so shall my word be</strong> that goes out from my mouth;
    <strong>
        it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I
        purpose, and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.”
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    
    Isn’t Jesus said to be the Word? Isn’t it clearly stated that his purpose
    was to save mankind, not condemn us? Won’t he succeed? I believe the
    Scriptures undeniably say that He will!
</p>
<p>
    Let God’s word speak to you.
</p>
<p>
    Then we can pray as Jesus’ taught us:
</p>

<p class="center">
    Your kingdom come.
</p>
<p class="center">
    Your will be done,
</p>
<p class="center">
    On earth as it is in heaven.
</p>
<p class="center">
    (Matthew 6:10)
</p>
	<p>
	And we can be sure that this prayer is not said in vain, knowing that it will be fulfilled as more people continue to become obedient to Christ in the present, and
    also that it will be fulfilled in its entirety when Christ reconciles "to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross" 
	(Colossians 1:20).</p><br>
