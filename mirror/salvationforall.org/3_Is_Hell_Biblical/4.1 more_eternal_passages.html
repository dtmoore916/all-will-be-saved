<h1>
    Other "Eternal" Passages</h1>

	<p>
    The belief in eternal punishment is so ingrained in the minds of the modern 
	church that it is necessary to address a few more passages that use this 
	terminology to describe judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's look at some of 
	these passages and carefully analyze them.</p>
	<h3>2 Thessalonians 1:8-10</h3>
	<blockquote>
		He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.&nbsp; 
		They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the 
		presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed... 
	</blockquote>
	<p>This passage is often cited as proof that unbelievers will spend eternity 
	in hell.&nbsp;&nbsp; But once again, it must be noted that the word 
	translated as "everlasting" is <em>aiōnion</em> (αἰώνιον).&nbsp; As we have 
	already discussed in some detail, this word connotes a time period of 
	limited duration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Still, some will argue that the word "destruction" in the passage 
	indicates a permanent destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The Greek word used in the passage is <em>olethron</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
	very same word is used in the following passage, referring to a man of the 
	church of Corinth who was participating in sexual immorality:</p>
	<h3>1 Corinthians 5:4-5</h3>
	<blockquote>
		So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord 
Jesus is present, hand this man over to Satan for the <strong>destruction</strong> 
of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.</blockquote>
<p>Notice that there is purpose to destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul is telling the 
Corinthian church to allow this man to experience the destructive nature of his 
sin (handing him over to Satan), <em>so that</em> he would be saved!&nbsp; God 
does not simply destroy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He destroys so that He can rebuild.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Like a contractor who has to destroy your wall to get rid of a mold infestation, 
God must destroy the sinful nature of man, in order to make him new.&nbsp; In 2 
Thessalonians, this same type of destruction is being described.&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
will soon see that this is a well-established biblical pattern in the section on 
biblical justice.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>But for now, let's examine another passage.</p>
	<h3>Hebrews 6:1-3</h3>
	<blockquote>Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.  And this we will do if God permits.</blockquote>
	<p>Now some will argue, based on the passage above, that eternal damnation 
	in hell is an elementary, fundamental doctrine of Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	But once again, we see that the word translated "eternal" is a form of
	<em>aionios (aiōniou).</em>&nbsp; And once again, we see that it is a 
	hell-biased translation since the word does not actually mean eternal in the 
	Greek.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
	<div class="box">Bonus Content for Grammar Geeks: <em>aiōniou </em>is the genitive case of the word <em>aionios</em> (which is in the nominative case).</div>
	<p>The Greek word translated "judgment" is <em>krimatos.</em>&nbsp; 
	According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/2917.htm">Strong's 
	Concordance</a>, it is defined as follows:</p>
	<blockquote> (a) a judgment, a verdict; sometimes implying an adverse verdict, a condemnation, (b) a case at law, a lawsuit.</blockquote>
	<p>So, it is essentially a legal term.&nbsp; We will soon examine God's law 
	and His justice, and we will see that eternal torment has never been part of 
	His legal code.&nbsp;&nbsp; But since the word judgment has almost come to 
	be <em>synonymous</em> with endless hell for many Christians, let's spend a 
	moment dispelling this myth: <em>it isn't</em>.&nbsp; In fact, there is 
	abundant biblical proof that even Christians will experience judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	We will examine this in some detail in our next major section on biblical 
	justice.&nbsp; But for now, just realize that "judgment" does not mean 
	"hell."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>So the pattern repeats.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Aionios</em> and its forms 
	are mistranslated repeatedly, giving the distinct impression to the 
	uninformed that hell must go on forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally every verse 
	that says something about "eternal" judgment of people makes this grave 
	error.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the thin thread on which the entire doctrine of 
	hell hangs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you willing to ignore abundant biblical evidence 
	for the salvation of all people because of a stubborn insistence that <em>
	aionios</em> must mean eternal (when this is clearly false)?&nbsp; If so, 
	why?</p>
	<h4>What about <em>aidios</em>?</h4
	>
	<p>Now, you may recall that there is another word that actually does mean 
	eternal: <em>aidios.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>You should rightly wonder whether this 
	word is found in the Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it turns out, it is found only 
	two times in the entire Bible, once in Jude and once in Romans.&nbsp; And it
	<em>never</em> refers to judgment of people!&nbsp; Let's look at how it is 
	used. </p
	>
	<h3>Romans 1:20</h3
	>
	<blockquote>
		For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his 
		<strong>eternal</strong> power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.</blockquote>
		<p>Here we see an appropriate usage of <em>aidios, </em>because it is 
		referring to God's eternal attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We see that this 
		passage is arguing that people can see certain aspects of God's nature 
		(His power and divinity) by looking at His creation.&nbsp; This is one 
		reason why we are all accountable to God, and therefore all need a 
		Savior (Jesus Christ).&nbsp; Fortunately, He did come to be the Savior 
		of the world, as we have seen. </p>
	<p>Now let's look at our final passage that uses <em>aidios</em>.&nbsp; I 
	hope you will see that this severs hell's thin lifeline, because it does 
	indeed.</p>
	<h3>Jude 1:6-7</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in 
		<strong>eternal</strong> (<em><strong>aidiois</strong></em>) chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day— just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.

	</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the judgment of angels is being discussed in the first part of the passage that uses the term 
	<em>aidiois</em> (an inflection of <em>aidios</em>).&nbsp; Also, notice that 
	it is used to describe their chains, but that they are only kept in these 
	chains <em>"until</em> the judgment of the great day."&nbsp; So even these 
	eternal chains have a temporary purpose and this is only in regards to 
	fallen angels, not people. </p>
	<p>In the second part of the passage, he begins to discuss Sodom and 
	Gomorrah as examples of judgment of people.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an 
	interesting analogy because the Scriptures actually tell us that even this 
	judgment was redemptive as we will examine shortly.&nbsp; Sodom gets 
	redeemed.&nbsp; It really is in the Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep reading to find 
	out where. </p>
	<p>But here's the really juicy part.&nbsp; Our English texts say "eternal" 
	again in this passage, referring to a punishment of "eternal" fire for 
	humans.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greek does NOT use the same 
	word for the fire of judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, it once again uses <em>aiōniou</em>, 
	which we have shown repeatedly to denote time periods of limited duration!</p>
	<p>Now, it must be asked:&nbsp; if Jude knew the term <em>aidios, </em>why 
	does he suddenly switch to <em>aionios </em>in the very same sentence?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	There is only one reasonable conclusion: Jude knew that the judgment of fire 
	for people is temporary, not eternal, so he chose the appropriate word to 
	describe what he meant.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Let's restate that again because it is critical.&nbsp; Jude knew the term
	<em>aidios.</em>&nbsp; He knew what it meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; He chose NOT to 
	use it in connection with the judgment of humans.&nbsp; Rather<em> in the 
	same sentence,</em> he chose to use a different word with a different 
	meaning that clearly contrasted with his earlier statement about the chains 
	of fallen angels. </p>
	<p>There is simply no good biblical reason to insist that hell is a place 
	of eternal punishment for people.&nbsp; Period.</p>
