<h2>
    Why the “Eternal” Confusion?
</h2>

<p>
    As we have seen the Hebrew word <em>o·v·lam
	</em>(<em>olam</em>) and the Greek word <em>aiónios</em> (and its
    derivatives) need not denote endlessness. Why then have translators chosen
    these words again and again? Were they trying to mislead us? Not
    necessarily. As I mentioned, translation is difficult and it is easily
    possible to make wrong inferences as to the intended meaning of a word.
    Most likely the reason for the persistent, systematic error we have seen
    can be found in the verse that we started this chapter with:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 25:46
</h3>
<blockquote>
    
    “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
    life.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    As a translator, you want to be consistent. Since we believe that eternal
    life really does go on forever, eternal punishment must be for the same
    duration, it is argued. Translators believed there was parallelism to the
    concepts of eternal punishment and eternal life. This seems like a
    reasonable inference if the verse is taken in isolation, but given our new
    understanding of the whole counsel of Scripture, it becomes suspect.
</p>
<p>
    It is certainly not a logical necessity.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s use a simple analogy to illustrate this point…
</p>
<p>
    Imagine that I say the following:
</p>
<p>
    “For a period of time I weighed about 8 pounds, but for another period of
    time, I weighed about 175 lbs.”
</p>
<p>
    Is it a logical necessity that the time periods are of the same duration? I
    only weighed about 8 pounds for a very short period of my life, but then I
    grew up, and now I weigh around 175 pounds. I’ve been around this weight
    for many years and may continue to weigh about 175 pounds until I die, for
    all I know. Likewise, it does not follow logically that the usage of the
    word <em>aiónios</em> must mean the same thing in all instances.
</p>
	<p>
    In fact, we have scriptural examples that prove that it does not, using <em>aiónios/olam</em> to denote different time periods in a parallel 
	fashion much like Matthew 25:46.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the following:</p>
	<h3>Habakkuk 3:6 (ESV)</h3>
	<blockquote>
		He stood and measured the earth;
    he looked and shook the nations;
then the eternal (<em>aiónios/olam</em>) mountains were scattered;
    the everlasting <em>(aiónios/ad</em>) hills sank low.
    His were the everlasting (<em>aiónios/olam</em>) ways.</blockquote>
	<p>Notice that the last line refers to God's ways as everlasting (<em>aiónios/olam</em>).&nbsp; 
	For God, the words "everlasting" or "eternal" must mean truly eternal, <em>
	without beginning or end</em>, because He is without beginning or end.&nbsp; 
	But if we apply this same definition to the eternal mountains and 
	everlasting hills, we must assert that they too have <em>no beginning or 
	end, which is obviously false. </em>&nbsp; The parallelism of the passage 
	does <em>not</em> support the concept that <em>aiónios </em>or <em>olam </em>
	must have equal duration.&nbsp; Instead, we see a refutation of that 
	argument.&nbsp; The duration being described is dependent on the noun being 
	modified.&nbsp; God's ways are truly eternal because He is God.&nbsp; 
	Mountains and hills are not eternal because they were created, and will 
	eventually disintegrate.&nbsp; In fact, Habakkuk 3:6 is describing the end 
	of these "eternal" mountains and hills, since they are being scattered (some 
	versions say "shattered") and sinking low (i.e. they are not hills anymore).&nbsp; </p>
	<div class="box">
		Please note: I am not inflecting <em>aiónios </em>for clarity and simplicity.&nbsp;Inflection 
		does <em>not</em> change a word's fundamental meaning in Greek; it just 
		makes it fit grammatically (by changing tense, case, or gender, etc.). 
To see the inflected form, you can download a Septuagint interlinear here:
<a href="https://apostolicbible.com/">https://apostolicbible.com/</a>.&nbsp; You 
can see the Hebrew interlinear here:<a href="https://biblehub.com/interlinear/habakkuk/3-6.htm">https://biblehub.com/interlinear/habakkuk/3-6.htm</a>. 
		You may also notice that the Hebrew word <em>ad </em>is also sometimes 
		translated as eternal or everlasting but that this appears to be a 
		mistake as well (since hills are not everlasting).&nbsp; 
	</div>
	<h3>Romans 16:25-26 (ASV)</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal 
		(<em>aiónios</em>), but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal 
		(<em>aiónios)</em> God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith...</blockquote>
	<p>
    I chose the American Standard Version for this example because it at least 
	makes an effort at consistency in translation.&nbsp; Many other versions 
	translate the first phrase that uses <em>aiónios </em>as "long ages past", 
	"since the world began",&nbsp; "the beginning of time" etc.&nbsp; These 
	versions, of course, do this because translating <em>aiónios </em>as 
	"eternal" in the context of a mystery that has already been revealed makes 
	no sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; In what possible way can a mystery hidden for eternity 
	be revealed?&nbsp; It, of course, cannot.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    It is also vital to notice that <em>aiónios </em>is used twice in this same 
	sentence, first to describe the times for which the mystery of Christ was 
	kept hidden, and second to describe God Himself.&nbsp; Again, when applied 
	to God the adjective "eternal" has the connotation of "without beginning or 
	end."&nbsp; This meaning clearly cannot be applied to the time for which a 
	mystery has been hidden, especially since that mystery is<em> no longer </em>
	hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    Both of these scriptural examples demonstrate that the argument that <em>
	aiónios </em>must always indicate the same 
	duration when used in parallel or in the same sentence, is not a good one.&nbsp; 
	Instead, we clearly see <em>aiónios </em>being used in the same sentence to 
	denote different ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its meaning is dependent on the noun it 
	is modifying in context.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    Recall that <em>aiónios</em> is an undefined period of time. In fact, it
    has a significant range of meaning in ancient Greek. Consider the following
    excerpt from <em>Word Studies in the New Testament </em>by Marvin Vincent
    (D.D., Baldwin Professor of Sacred Literature at Union Theological
    Seminary, New York):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
    Aristotle says: "The period which includes the whole time of each one's
    life is called the aion (eon) of each one." (Peri Ouravou, i.9, 15)
</p>
<p>
    Hence, it often means the life of a man, as in Homer, where one's life
    (aion) is said to leave him or consume away (Iliad. v. 685; Odessy. v.
    160). It is not, however, limited to human life;
</p>
<p>
    It signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age
    before Christ in the flesh; the period of the millennium (the 1000 year
    reign of Christ to come); the mythological period before the beginnings of
    history. The word has not a "stationary and mechanical value" (De Quincey).
    It does not mean a period of a fixed length for all cases. There is one
    aion of a human life, another of the life of a nation, another of a crow's
    life, another of an oak's life.
</p>
<p>
    The length of the aion depends on the subject to which it is attached. It
    is sometimes translated "world," with "world" representing a period or a
    series of periods of time. (See Matt 12:32; Matt 13:40-49; 1 Cor. 1:20; 1
    Cor. 1:20; Ephesians 1:21). Similarly the worlds, the universe, the
    aggregate of the ages or periods, and their contents which are included in
    the duration of the world. (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Cor. 10:11; Heb. 1:2; Heb 9:26;
    Heb 11:3)
</p>
<p>
    The word always carries the notion of time, and not of eternity. It always
    means a period of time. Otherwise it would be impossible to account for the
    plural, or for such qualifying expressions as this age, or the age to come.
    It does not mean something endless or everlasting. . . . The adjective
    aionios in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the noun nor the
    adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or everlasting (pp.
    58-59, vol. IV, Vincent's Word Studies of the New Testament, retrieved from
    <a href="http://mercifultruth.com/eternity.html">
        Merciful Truth: Eternity
    </a>
    )
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Dr. Vincent also notes that “<em>aionios</em> means ―enduring through or
    ―pertaining to a period of time. Both the noun and the adjective are
    applied to limited periods....Out of the 150 instances in LXX, [Greek Old
    Testament/the Septuagint] four fifths imply limited duration”&nbsp; 
	(Beauchemin 2010, page 25)

    </a>
    )
<br>
</div>
<p>
    Did you see the amount of variation exhibited by the word “aion” and its
    adjective derivative aionios, everything ranging from the length of a man’s
    life, to an indefinitely long duration? Did you also notice that the vast
    majority of the time that the words are used in the Septuagint, they imply
    limited duration? It is quite strange to insist that the words must mean
    denote eternity when they clearly do not do so most of the time.
</p>
<p>
    Other scholars agree with this assessment.

Divinity at Cambridge University. In    <em>Ellicott's Commentary on the Whole Bible</em> he writes the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    (Matt. 25:46).
    <em>
        Everlasting punishment--life eternal. The two adjectives represent the
        same Greek word, <strong>aionios</strong> it must be admitted that the
        Greek word which is rendered "eternal" does not, in itself, involve
        endlessness, but rather, duration, whether through an age or succession
        of ages, and that it is therefore applied in the N.T. to periods of
        time that have had both a beginning and ending (Rom. 16:25).
    </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    James Hastings was a well respected Scottish minister who received
    honorary
        Doctor of Divinity
    degrees from both the University of Aberdeen (1897) and
        Queen's University
    in
        Nova Scotia
    (1920).&nbsp;
    In <em>Hastings</em>
    <em>
        ’ Dictionary of the New Testament (Vol. I, p. 542, art. Christ and the
        Gospels
    </em>
    ) he explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
    
        Eternity. There is no word either in the O.T. Hebrew or the N.T. Greek
        to express the abstract idea of eternity.
   
    (Vol. III, p. 369):
    
        Eternal, everlasting—nonetheless "eternal" is misleading, inasmuch as
        it has come in the English to connote the idea of "endlessly existing,"
        and thus to be practically a synonym for "everlasting." But this is not
        an adequate rendering of <strong><em>aionios</em></strong> which varies in
        meaning with the variations of the noun <strong><em>aion</em></strong> from
        which it comes.
    
    (p. 370)

<p>
    Notice that the word <em>aionios</em> “varies in meaning with the
    variations of the noun aion from which it comes” (Hastings) and that the
    “length of the aion depends on the subject to which it is attached”
    (Vincent). Therefore it makes sense that the <em>aionios</em> life that we
    are offered is indeed everlasting (and so much more), because it is
    describing the life that comes from knowing God and Christ (who is the way,
    the truth and the <em>life). Aionios</em>, however, does not always connote
endlessness, especially when it is describing a word such as    <em>kolasin </em>(corrective punishment that has the goal of restoration).&nbsp;
    Indeed, in such a context, this interpretation would be nonsensical.
</p>
<p>
    It is not difficult to understand the concept that an adjective can connote
    different lengths of time depending on the noun that it modifies. In fact,
    this principle applies in English as well. Here is an example:
</p>
<p>
    If I say that my dog is “old,” it is reasonable to assume that it is about
    12 years old or so, but certainly not 105. If I say that a Giant Sequoia is
    “old,” it is almost certainly hundreds of years old. Notice that the
    adjective (“old”) has different meanings depending on the subject it is
    modifying, just as <em>aionios</em> does in the Greek.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion: Is “hell” Eternal?
</h2>
<p>
    It seems incredibly unlikely that the correction that sinners will receive
    as a result of God’s judgment will be eternal suffering. There is no solid
    linguistic basis for the translation from either Greek or Hebrew being
    rendered this way. Rather, it reflects a bias passed on to the translators
    who were taught to believe in the traditional doctrine of hell.
</p>
<p>
    Since this translation is the primary rationale for believing in 
	the doctrine of hell, and since this translation seems to be contradictory 
	to many plain biblical truths (as outlined in earlier chapters), it is 
	foolhardy to insist on its veracity. We are called to “…honor Christ the 
	Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you 
	for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and 
	respect, having a good conscience, so that,
    when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may
    be put to shame” (1 Peter 3:15-16). How can we obey this command if we
    insist on defending a false premise (the doctrine of hell) that robs people
    of hope and at times makes us feel hopeless for the lost? Let’s drop this
    false premise and preach the incredibly good news that Jesus Christ is
    indeed the "Savior of the world” <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A14&amp;version=ESV"
    >(1 John 4:14)</a>
     just as the Scriptures have plainly told us!
