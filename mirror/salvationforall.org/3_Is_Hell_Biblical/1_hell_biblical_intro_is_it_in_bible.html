<h1>
    Is the Doctrine of hell Biblical?
</h1>

<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    So far, a reader of this argument should <em>rightly</em> be somewhat
    confused. What about all of the passages in the Bible describing hell as
    eternal, as the lake of fire, as outer darkness, and as a place where the
    worm doesn’t die and the fire is never quenched? What about those passages?
</p>
<p>
    I am glad you asked, because they will not be ignored. In fact, they are
    extremely important to examine in order to find the beauty of the gospel,
    and critical to understanding the wonderful redemptive story described
    throughout all of Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    But before we do this, let’s do our best to define the traditional doctrine
    of hell that I’m arguing against. There are several “orthodox” versions of
    the doctrine but they all basically say something like this:
</p>
<p>
    1. If a person dies without knowing Jesus as their personal Lord and
    Savior, then they will go to a place called hell.
</p>
<p>
    2. Hell is a place of torment, suffering, and separation from God. Usually
    the torment is said to be “conscious.”
</p>
<p>
    3. Different Christian groups have differing views on how literally or
    figuratively to interpret the imagery used to describe hell, but agree that
    it will be really, really awful.
</p>
<p>
    4. Hell is a place that people will be in forever, with no hope of ever
    escaping or coming into right relationship with God.
</p>
<p>
    I think that is a pretty fair description of the doctrine as it is
    generally described although there are some subtle variations.
</p>
<h2>
    Is “hell” in the Bible?
</h2>
<p>
    Now, let’s examine the biblical evidence for the doctrine of hell described
    above. First off, we should determine if the word “hell” is found in the
    Bible at all. This is not difficult to do anymore. With the internet, you
    can get practically any English translation of the Bible and search it
    using sites like Bible Gateway or Bible Hub (which are both fantastic
    resources). If you do the search, you will find that the word is in fact
    used 13 times in the Bible and 11 of those times by Jesus himself, which is
    the reason why some argue that Jesus talked more about hell than anyone
    (you may have heard that as an argument before for why you must accept the
    traditional doctrine). It is also used once by Peter and once by James. So
    is hell in the Bible?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is yes, it is… and NO, IT ISN’T.
</p>
<p>
    You may be thinking that I’m clearly nuts in making the above statement.
    But read on carefully and you will see what I mean.
</p>
<p>
    I’m sure you’re probably aware of the fact that the Scriptures weren’t
    originally written in English. The languages used in the original writings
    and teachings were Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek, depending on the context and
    the audience they were presented to. So, the English versions that we read
    are all <em>translations</em>. Translations are necessary. Consider the
    following:
</p>
<p>
    Καὶ ἔδειξεν ποταμὸν ὕδατος ζωῆς λαμπρὸν κρύσταλλον ἐκπορευόμενον θρόνου
    θεοῦ ἀρνίου
</p>
<p>
    Yeah, I didn’t get it either… It’s actually Revelation 22:1 but I clearly
    wouldn’t understand how to read it as is and in fact couldn’t even copy it
correctly because “early <strong>Greek</strong> was written    <strong>right-to-left</strong>, just like Phoenician. However, eventually
    its direction changed to boustrophedon (which means "ox-turning"), where
    the direction of writing changes every line” (<a href="http://www.ancientscripts.com/greek.html" class="auto-style1">click for citation).
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Weird… (no offense to ancient Greeks).
</p>
<p>
    So translation is necessary, and the translating of the Bible is a
    wonderful thing that makes the Word of God accessible to people from every
    tribe, tongue and nation. I am very thankful and greatly appreciate the
    hard work of translators.
</p>
<p>
    But translating is difficult! This is especially true when not only
    language, but culture differs markedly between people groups.
</p>
<p>
    So, what does this have to do with hell and why did I write that it is NOT
    in the Bible?
</p>
<p>
    The reason is that, in every instance that the word “hell” is used as a
    translation in the Bible (except one), the actual term being used was
    Gehenna (Valley of Hinnom, aka Valley of Ben Hinnom). Naturally, an English
    speaker* would not be familiar with the meaning of Gehenna or the Valley of
    Hinnom, so it was translated as “hell,” a word that English speakers were
    more familiar with because it was tied to their own pagan mythology (more
    on this later).
</p>
<div class="box">
    (*note: I am using the term English speaker generically as the English
    language has evolved significantly from a Proto-Germanic origin and since there are significant
    linguistic connections between Northern European tribes of the time
    period…)
</div>
<p>
So now let’s look at all the instances of the word “hell” in the    <em>entire</em> Bible and substitute them with a more literal translation:

<p>
    So the word translated “hell” was an actual place that Jesus’ audience knew
    about! It was the dump! It was also clearly unclean and repulsive, not only
    because it was a place of rotting garbage, but also because it was the
    place where the Israelites had falsely worshipped Baal and Molech by
    burning their own children as sacrifices to false gods.
</p>
<p>
    Not surprisingly, God did not approve of this latter practice of child
    sacrifice by immolation. Read what he says through the prophet Jeremiah.

        detestable thing

    He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one
could use it    <strong>to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire</strong> to Molek.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that God finds the burning (presumably alive) of children
    detestable. I think our consciences innately agree. Several questions must
    then be asked: Would <em>He</em> do this to his children or to any human
    being as is suggested by the doctrine of hell? Aren’t <em>we</em> His
    <a href="childrenofGod.html">children</a>?&nbsp; It clearly was an abomination to Him and inconsistent with His
    character (more on this later). Yet the popular doctrine of hell suggests
    that this may be exactly what God is doing, tormenting people endlessly in
    flames (whether literal or figurative). The interpretation of the Valley of
    Ben Hinnom as promoted by the doctrine of hell aligns God with the horrific
    practices of idol worship and child sacrifice that He clearly despised.
    This is not only illogical and inconsistent with the rest of Scripture, but
    also <em>maligns the name of God</em>. I really, really don’t want to do
    that!
</p>
<h2>
    Other Observations on Gehenna (“hell”)
</h2>
<p>
    There are several other noteworthy observations to be made about Jesus’
    references to Gehenna. Let’s examine them carefully, using our Bibles for
    confirmation.
</p>
<h4>
    It is <em>never</em> stated that Gehenna is eternal or everlasting.
</h4>
<p>
    This is an interesting observation because it is frequently argued that
    Jesus spoke “hell” in this manner. On the contrary, He <em>never </em>spoke
    of “hell” using any words that denoted duration at all. This is an
    inference being made because people assume that Jesus is speaking of
    Gehenna in other passages in which he does not use the term. While this
    inference may be valid, it is not demanded by the text.
</p>
<h4>
    It is <em>never</em> stated that Gehenna is a place of conscious torment.
</h4>
<p>
    Jesus never says anything about conscious torment in any of the passages
    that mention “hell.” He does mention destruction of body and soul, saying
    that we should fear God because he is able to destroy (<em>apolesai</em> in
    the Greek) both. This word denotes destruction, not torment. Also, it is
    worth noting that the text does <em>not say</em> that He <em>will</em>
    destroy both body and soul, just that He <em>is able</em>. In other words,
    he has the ultimate power and is worthy of reverence.
</p>
<h4>
    It is likely that Gehenna represented national judgment to the Israelites
</h4>
<p>
    Because the Valley of Hinnom evoked images of national judgment in the
    minds of Jesus’ audience, it is likely that they understood his warnings in
    this light. I won’t spend a ton of time on this but there is a great
    exposition of this view here:
    <a href="http://makepeacewithjesus.org/19-gehenna-part-1">
        (click to see resource)</a>.&nbsp; I’d recommend taking a look at it as well as the rest of the articles in
    the series, as they are excellent resources. Nevertheless, we will look at
    a short summary of the understanding that Gehenna was representative of the
    destruction that took place at the hands of the Babylonian empire.
</p>
<h3>
    Jeremiah 7:32
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <em>
        ‘Therefore, behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when
        <strong>
            it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of
            Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in
            Topheth because there is no other place.’
        </strong>
        (7:32)
    </em>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <em>Jeremiah </em>
    19:1-8
</h3>
<blockquote>
    This is what the Lord says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take
along some of the elders of the people and of the priests and go out to    <strong>the Valley of Ben Hinnom</strong>, near the entrance of the
    Potsherd Gate. There proclaim the words I tell you, and say, ‘Hear the word
    of the Lord, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the
    Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a
    disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it
    tingle. For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods;
    they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their
    ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place
    with the blood of the innocent. They have built the high places of Baal to
    burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not
    command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. So beware, the days are
coming, declares the Lord, when people will no longer call this place    <strong>Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom</strong>, but the Valley of
    Slaughter.

<br>
    “‘In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make
    them
    <strong>
        fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want
        to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and
        the wild animals.
    </strong>
    I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all
    who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds…”

<br/>
    “Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, and say to
them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I will    <strong>smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar</strong>
is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will    <strong>bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room</strong>…’”
</blockquote>
<p>
    So you see the Valley of Ben Hinnom was a place of temporary, earthly
    destruction and death. The Babylonian empire did in fact invade and destroy
    Jerusalem and killed so many people that the Valley became full of corpses.
    This was undoubtedly the interpretive context of Jesus’ Jewish audience.
    They knew exactly what had happened as a result of their former
    disobedience and almost certainly interpreted Jesus’ warnings about Gehenna
    (the Valley of Ben Hinnom) to mean that Jerusalem would once again be laid
    waste and Gehenna be the refuse heap for those killed.
</p>
<p>
    And in A.D 70, this very thing happened! Jerusalem was destroyed and so
    many killed that the historian Josephus claimed that the death count was
    over 1 million. He says that the “number of those that perished during the
    whole siege” was “eleven hundred thousand, the greater part of whom were
    indeed of the same nation [with the citizens of Jerusalem], but not
    belonging to the city itself; for they were come up from all the country to
    the feast of unleavened bread…” (Josephus,
    <em>
        <a
            href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jews/Book_VI#Chapter_9"
            title="s:The War of the Jews/Book VI"
        >
            The Wars of the Jews VI.9.3
        </a>
    </em>
    ).
</p>
<p>
    It is certainly possible that Jesus was warning his Jewish audience of this
    impending judgment, just as the prophets had done before Him. Some would
    argue that this is the only context in which to appropriately interpret
    Jesus’ warnings on Gehenna. While I’m not personally prepared to argue that
    point, there is certainly some merit to it. Nevertheless, it is clear that
    the destruction of Jerusalem was a judgment that has already been
    completed, not an everlasting one.
</p>
<h2>
    The Tongue (Set on Fire by a Place of Eternal Punishment?)
</h2>
<p>
    We must also address the use of the term Gehenna in the text of James 3:6
    which says “the tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of
    the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life
    on fire, and is itself set on fire by
    <strong>
        <s>
            hell
        </s>
        (
    </strong>
    <strong>Valley of Hinnom/Gehenna).” </strong>
    Is it reasonable to assert that the tongue is set on fire by a place of
    eternal torment? In short, the answer is no (because this makes no sense).
</p>
<p>
    It does, however, make sense if we consider the original meaning of the
    term Gehenna as the unclean, filthy dump where the flesh is rotting. It
    brings to mind our sinful natures that need to be purified by God’s
    consuming fire. Similar imagery is used in Matthew 23:27, where Jesus says:
    “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like
    whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they
    are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.” In a sense, Jesus was
    comparing the hearts of the Pharisees to a place as unclean as Gehenna, a
    tomb full of dead men. This view of Gehenna actually makes sense in the
    context of James’ discussion of the evils we can cause with our speech.
    Viewing it as a hell of eternal suffering clearly does not.
</p>
<h2>
    What is tartarōsas?
</h2>
<p>
    Now that we’ve established the true meaning of most of the “hell”
    references in the Bible, we need to address the final usage of this
    translation. Here it is again for review.

    <strong>5020</strong>

for the <em>netherworld</em> – the place of    <em>punishment fit only for demons</em>. Later, <em>Tartaros</em> came to

    "<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/5020.htm">5020</a> (<em>tartaróō</em>)
is a Greek name for the <em>under-world</em>, especially the abode of the    <em>damned</em> – hence <em>to cast into hell</em>" (<em>A-S</em>); to send
into the <em>subterranean abyss</em> reserved for    <em>demons and the dead</em>.
<br><br>

    [In Greek mythology, Tartarus was a "place of punishment under the earth,
    to which, for example, the Titans were sent" (Souter).]

<p>
    There are several highly significant things to notice about this. First, it
    is a place for sinful angels (demons).
</p>
<p>
    Second, it clearly is not a permanent destination. Notice that they were
    sent there in chains “<strong>to be held for judgment.</strong>” Therefore,
    it is somewhere demons reside <em>prior</em> to judgment and clearly can
    NOT be the lake of fire. So in the word study above, the fact that “later,
    Tartaros came to represent eternal punishment for wicked people,”
    demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of this passage.
</p>
<p>
    Third, it is a word derived from Greek mythology. Since Peter was speaking
    to a Greek-speaking audience, it appears that he chose a familiar myth to
    make it clearer to his audience that even sinful angels are held captive
    awaiting judgment.
</p>
<p>
    At any rate, this “hell” described by Peter is clearly not a place of
    eternal punishment for people as proponents of the hell doctrine would have
    you believe.
