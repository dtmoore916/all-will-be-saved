<h2>
    Is “hell” Biblical? The “Eternal” Question
    
</h2>
<p>
    By now we have seen that the salvation of all people is deeply biblical
    and found throughout Scripture. We’ve also seen that “hell” isn’t really a
    proper translation of <em>Gehenna</em>, <em>Tartaros</em>, <em>Sheol</em>
    or <em>Hades</em>. But there is still a problem that hasn’t been addressed,
    and if we only read the English translations of the Bible, it is huge. Here
    it is below, in reference to the parable of the sheep and the goats:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 25:46
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
    life.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Well, there you have it. All this great evidence we’ve been discussing from
    all throughout the Bible contradicted in a single statement, really in a
    single word: <em>eternal</em>.&nbsp; This same word and related forms of it are also
    translated as “forever and ever” and “everlasting.” I guess I never should
    have begun writing this… if only I’d read Matthew 25:46, I could have saved
    myself a lot of time…
</p>
<p>
    I am, of course, being facetious. Of course I’ve read those passages. They
    are the only reason that the doctrine of hell seemed immovable, the reason
    I felt trapped in a faith that was supposed to be freeing. There seemed to
    be no way out…
</p>
<p>
    But I have realized something recently (I think with God's help).&nbsp; You may recall that we discussed
    the fact that Satan uses Scripture to deceive us when he takes it out of
    context and twists it to mean something other than its true meaning, and
    that he used the same tactic to try to tempt Jesus in the desert.&nbsp; The 
	reason I bring this up is that we’ve been looking at the context of the entire Bible, and this concept of
    eternal torment just isn’t consistent with this overall context. </p>
<p>
    What do we say then? Does the Bible contradict itself?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is NO! But how is this possible?
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that the answer comes down once again to <em>translation</em>.
</p>
<p>
    But before we delve into the problems with the translations of our Bibles,
    I want you to notice something <em>critical</em>. The <em>entire</em>
    doctrine of hell as a place of everlasting punishment rests on the
    translation of <em>one</em> word in the New Testament (and its
    derivative forms).
</p>
<p>
    So, if the word is translated incorrectly, the doctrine of hell is doomed!
</p>
<p>
    Don’t you see it? Think about it if you don’t.
</p>
<p>
    Now let’s get into it.
</p>
<p>
    First, let’s begin with the verse that I used to open the chapter, Matthew
    25:46:
</p>
<p>
    “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal
    life.”
</p>
<p>
    There’s a really remarkable thing that we can do now in the information
    age: find information! It is readily available and incredibly easy to find
    if you really look for it. In the past we had to take the “experts” word
    for it. No longer. You can see the original Greek for any passage in the
    Bible online. Here is Matthew 25:46 (by the way you can click on any of 
	these lexicon images to make them larger or just visit them by clicking the 
	hyperlinks below the images):
</p>
	
    <a href="lexicon%20mat25.gif">
	<img alt="NASB Lexicon Matthew 25:26" class="auto-style1" src="lexicon%20mat25.gif"></a>
	<p class="center" style="font-size:x-small">Retrieved from <a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/matthew/25-46.htm">BibleHub.com</a> </p>
<p>
    Notice that the definition can be agelong or eternal according to the
    lexicon. So it does NOT necessarily mean eternal, and can mean an undefined
    agelong span of time.
</p>
<p>
    Also, notice the meaning of the term translated “punishment” in the NASB
    version. The Greek is Κόλασιν (kolasin) which means “correction”!&nbsp; The word
    “correction” clearly implies the type of discipline that leads to
    repentance and correct behavior. It has a very different sense than
    mere punishment (which may or may not be purposeful). There is a clear purpose
    to correction: restoration! Doesn’t it sound absurd to translate the text
    as “eternal correction?” But since there was a bias toward the doctrine of
    hell (and its eternal nature) in the translation, “punishment” was chosen.
</p>
	<div class="box">
    For a much more in-depth explanation for why <em>kolasin</em> should be thought of as corrective punishment (and why attempts to deny this truth are misguided), see 
	<a href="../10_Strongholds/7-kolasin-meaning.html">here</a>.
</div>
	<p>Now let’s go a bit deeper by looking at some more verses.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 14:11 (ESV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And the smoke of their torment goes up <strong>forever</strong> and    <strong>ever</strong>, and they have no rest, day or night, these
    worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its
    name.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Let’s look at the actual words translated “forever and ever”:
</p>
	<p>
    <a href="img17.gif">
    <img alt="lexiconRev14" src="img17.gif" class="auto-style1"></a></p>


	<p class="center" style="font-size:x-small">
	(retrieved from
            <a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/revelation/14-11.htm">
		(BibleHub.com)</a></p>
    
    <p>
    Notice that 
	both of these words have the same root, <em>aión </em>(αἰῶν). <em>&nbsp;Aión </em>is the noun from which the adjective 
	<em>aiónios</em> is derived.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice too that the proper meaning 
	of <em>aión</em> is “a space of time, an age.” The Greek words <em>aiōnas</em> and <em>aiōnōn</em> 
	are plural forms of <em>aión </em>and would therefore properly be translated 
	as "ages" or "spaces of time."&nbsp; A “space of
    time” or an “age” do not necessarily mean (and usually don't mean) “forever.”&nbsp; 
	The literal and most accurate translation of the phrase <em>aiōnas</em> <em>aiōnōn </em>
	is "ages of ages."&nbsp; Although the preposition "of" does not appear as a 
	separate word in the Greek, it would be understood because <em>aiōnōn </em>
	is in the genitive case, which indicates possession.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    It is apparent that the English phrase "forever and ever" does not 
	accurately portray the meaning of the Greek.&nbsp; There are several 
	important observations that should make this clear:</p>
	<p>
    1. It inserts the conjunction "and" where it is not actually found.&nbsp; 
	Instead, the preposition "of" should have been used to indicate possession 
	as mandated by the fact that <em>aiōnōn </em>is in the genitive case.&nbsp; 
	In Greek, the word <em>kai</em> (και) means "and" but <em>kai</em> is not present in the phrase.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    2. Both <em>aiōnas</em> and <em>aiōnōn </em>are nouns.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forever" 
	and "ever" are both adverbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nouns and adverbs are different 
	parts of speech with completely different functions.&nbsp; It is not good 
	translation practice to replace nouns with adverbs for this reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    3. Both <em>aiōnas</em> and <em>aiōnōn </em>are plural forms of <em>aiōn</em>.&nbsp; 
	Since <em>aiōn </em>means "age," they can only be rightly translated as 
	"ages."&nbsp; There is no plural form of "forever" or "ever."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
    It is therefore undeniable that the translation of <em>aiōnas</em> <em>aiōnōn </em>as 
	"forever and ever" is neither a literal translation, nor an accurate one.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	It does not capture the original meaning of the words at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The phrase "ages of ages" however, is not commonly used in everyday English, 
	so there may be some question as to its meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that 
	the most straightforward reading of its meaning can be understood by 
	considering the following truths:</p>
	<p>
    1.&nbsp; Time consists of a series of ages, as the Bible describes.</p>
	<p>
    2.&nbsp; Ages are timespans of undefined lengths.</p>
	<p>
    3.&nbsp; Each person will be rewarded or punished according to what they 
	have done (Matthew 16:27, Romans 2:6,&nbsp; 2 Corinthians 5:10, Revelation 
	20:12, Isaiah 59:18, Psalm 62:12 etc.).</p>
	<p>
    Based off of these three understandings, I propose that the best 
	understanding of the phrase <em>aiōnas</em> <em>aiōnōn</em> is that those 
	who are in the lake of fire will experience their punishment for the 
	appropriate <em>number of ages out of the total number of ages</em> that 
	comprise the rest of time, until the end (at which point all will be united 
	in Christ as stated in Ephesians 1:9-10).&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person will 
	receive the appropriate duration of corrective punishment that corresponds 
	to their life's actions.&nbsp; But once a person repents, entrance into 
	God's kingdom becomes possible.&nbsp; Consider the following statement in 
	Revelation, remembering that it is made <em>after </em>the judgment of the 
	lake of fire in regards to those who are not yet a part of the New Jerusalem 
	that has descended from heaven:</p>
	<h3>Revelation 22:14 (ESV)</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.
    &nbsp;</blockquote>
    <p>The robes are washed in the blood of the Lamb (as stated in Revelation 7:14), symbolizing the sanctification provided by Christ's atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world (1 John 2:2).&nbsp; 
	Remember that this statement is made <em>after</em> the great white throne 
	judgment of Revelation 20, <em>after</em> the new Jerusalem has come "down 
	out of heaven from God" with its perpetually open gates (Revelation 21), and 
	that those outside the gates are the wicked (Revelation 22:15).&nbsp; These 
	wicked are those who are invited in, but they do not enter until they are no 
	longer wicked, until the power of Christ's loving sacrifice and righteous 
	judgment has transformed them from enemies to loyal subjects and friends.</p>
	<p>The amount of time that this will take for different individuals does not 
	need to be equal.&nbsp; Each person will experience judgment for a 
	particular age, or number of ages that is necessary.&nbsp; The idea that 
	time can be subdivided into periods of different duration is actually not 
	even a foreign concept at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do this all the time.&nbsp; 
	Centuries consist of decades, decades of years, years of days, days of hours 
	and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that I was alive in the 2oth century does 
	not mean that I experienced all of the decades that comprised this time 
	span.&nbsp; In fact, I was only around for two <em>decades of the decades</em> 
	that comprise the 2oth century.&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems to be perfectly 
	analogous to the Greek construction <em>aiōnas</em> <em>aiōnōn </em>(ages of 
	ages).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Moreover, this concept is consistent with biblical views of justice, in 
	which the sentence for a crime should match the crime's severity.&nbsp; The 
	punishment for an impoverished Hindu orphan that did not understand (or even 
	hear) the gospel should not match the punishment of a mass murderer.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This is both biblically and intuitively obvious, and consistent with the 
	many verses that explain that people will be judged according to their 
	deeds.</p>
	<h4>Derivatives of <em>Aiōn </em>and <em>Aiónios</em></h4>
<p>
    We can see, therefore, that there are two primary words (and their 
	derivations) that are used to argue for the eternality of punishment:&nbsp; 
	the noun <em>aión</em>, and the adjective <em>aiónios</em>.&nbsp; Now, let's 
	look at both of these as described in two respected sources.&nbsp; You can find these

<p>
    So the words translated to mean eternal, everlasting, or forever and ever 
	are
    extraordinarily rich, and diverse in meaning. Now let’s add to the
    complexity of this word a bit more by seeing how Jesus’ defined it.
</p>
<h3>
    John 17:3 (NIV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now this is eternal (<em>aiónios</em>) life: that they know you, the only true God,
    and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
</blockquote>
<p>
    So now in the sense that Jesus used it, eternal life isn’t really about
    time at all but rather about knowing “the only true God and Jesus Christ.”
    Are you confused yet? There is complex meaning here. The words are nuanced
    and rich.
</p>
<p>
    Is it really appropriate to insist that hell is a place of everlasting
    conscious torment based <em>solely </em>on such a word as aiónios?
</p>
<p>
    I don’t believe that it is… and I don’t think you should either.</p>
	<p>
    &nbsp;But since
    the translation of the words <em>aion, aiónios</em>, and <em>aiónion</em>
    are so critical to the argument for eternal punishment, let’s continue our
    examination of these words in both scriptural and extra-biblical Greek
    literature of the time period.
</p>
<h4>
    Uses of Aion and its Derivatives in Other Parts of the Bible
</h4>
<h3>
    Colossians 1:25-29
</h3>
<blockquote>
   
    Of <em>this church</em> I was made a minister according to the stewardship
    from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out
    the <em>preaching of</em> the word of God,<em> that is</em>, the mystery
which has been hidden from the <strong><em>past</em> ages </strong>(<em>aiōnōn</em><em>: </em><strong>plural form of <em>aion</em></strong>)
    and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God
    willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among
    the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim Him,
    admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we
    may present every man complete in Christ. For this purpose also I labor,
    striving according to His power, which mightily works within me.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see the concept that multiple ages (<em>aiōnōn</em>) have already
    occurred (they are <em>past</em>). It is not possible to traverse an
    infinite span of time and saying that multiple infinite time spans have
    already passed is inane. This is why <em>aiōnōn </em>is translated as ages
because “eternities” is clearly nonsensical, and because “ages” is what    <em>aiōnōn </em>actually, literally means!
</p>
<h3>
    Galatians 1:3-4
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil    <strong>age (</strong><strong><em>aion</em></strong><em>).</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Does Christ rescue us from a present evil <em>eternity</em>? Again,    <em>aion<strong> </strong></em>is appropriately translated age because that
    is what it means!
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 1:21
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “…in accordance with the working of the strength of His might which He
    brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at
    His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and
power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in    <u>this age</u> (<em>aion</em>) but also in <u>the one to come.</u>
</blockquote>
<p>

    Again we see the word <em>aion</em> appropriately translated as age. And in
    this example we see that there is not only a present <em>aion</em> but also
a future <em>aion</em> that will come afterward. If the present<em> aion </em>were eternal, we could of course never get to the next    <em>aion, </em>because the age we are in would last forever.
</p>
<h3>
    Titus 1:2
</h3>
<blockquote>
…in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised    <u>long ages ago</u>…
</blockquote>
<p>
The phrase translated “long ages ago” is ‘<em>pro </em>    <em>chronōn aiōniōn.</em>’ Here again we see that ages have already past.
    This doesn’t make sense if <em>aiōniōn </em>(a plural form of
    <em>aiōnios</em>) means “eternities.”&nbsp; An accurate translation would be 
something more like this: "before the times of the ages" because <em>pro</em> 
means "before,"<em> chronōn </em>is a plural form of the noun time, and    <em>
aiōniōn </em>is the genitive masculine plural form of <em>aionios</em>.&nbsp; It 
cannot be rendered that this promise was made long <em>eternities ago </em>
because it would be impossible to traverse multiple (or even one) eternity to 
arrive at the present.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
So, it can be seen that in the New Testament, the terms <em>aion</em> and    <em>aionios </em>are not consistently 
<em>translated</em> as eternal, nor do they
    have this connotation. In fact, translating the words as eternal does not
    make sense in a significant number of passages. If, however, you
    consistently translate <em>aion</em> and <em>aionios</em> as “age” and
“age-like” or “age-long” in every passage    <em>they do make perfect sense!</em>
</p>
<h4>
    In the Septuagint
</h4>
<p>
    As a reminder, the Septuagint was a Greek translation of the Hebrew Old
    Testament that was completed in the second century B.C. As such, it
    provides valuable insights into the Greek words that were used to translate
    Hebrew concepts near the lifetime of Christ. Consider the following
examples in which the Hebrew word <em>olam</em> was translated as    <em>aion </em>or <em>aionios.</em>
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 58:12
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Those from among you will rebuild the ancient (<em>aionioi</em>) ruins;
    you will raise up the age-old (<em>aionia</em>) foundations; and you will
    be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of the streets in which
    to dwell.”
</blockquote>
<p>
Here we see the words “ancient” and “age-old” being represented by    <em>aionios</em>. Obviously, neither “ancient” nor “age-old” mean
    everlasting or eternal. In fact, the context of the verse prohibits such an
    interpretation. It is clear that the adjective <em>aionios </em>means that
    something pertains to an <em>aion </em>(age), in this case an age from long
    ago.
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 34:9-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch,
    <br/>
    and her soil into sulfur;
    <br/>
    her land shall become burning pitch.
    <br/>
    Night and day it shall not be quenched;
    <br/>
its smoke shall go up forever (<strong>α</strong><strong>ἰῶνα/aiōna</strong>)…
</blockquote>
<p>
    Is the smoke from Edom still rising? Can we go there and see it? I imagine
    such a sight would be quite noticeable, with smoke rising perpetually
    forever. An age-long period of smoke rising, however, seems reasonable.
</p>
<h3>
    Jonah 2:6
</h3>
<blockquote>
    To the roots of the mountains I sank down;
    <br/>
    the earth beneath barred me in forever (αἰώνιοι/<em> aionioi</em>).
    <br/>
    But you, Lord my God,
    <br/>
    brought my life up from the pit.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Jonah is praying to God from inside the great fish that had swallowed him.
    Notice that the term <em>aionios </em>simply <em>cannot</em> mean forever
    in this context, for several reasons. First, we know that Jonah was only in
    the belly of the fish for <em>3 days</em>, not forever. Second, the verse
    itself contradicts the notion of him being barred in forever, because it
    says that the LORD brought his “life up from the pit.”
<p>
    Now, some will argue that Jonah was using the term figuratively because it
    felt like forever. But then it has to be admitted that the term can be used
    hyperbolically, which calls into question the interpretation that it must
    be literal when referring to “hell.” However, given the vast number of
    times that the term denotes a limited time span in the Bible and elsewhere
in Greek literature, it is far more intellectually honest to admit that    <em>aionios</em> 
	simply doesn’t mean everlasting or forever or eternal.&nbsp; Indeed, in this 
	passage and many others it <em>cannot</em> because interpreting it this way 
	is obviously absurd.&nbsp;
</p>
	<div class="box">
    Interesting fact: In Jonah 2:6, the form of  <em>aionios </em>used is <em>aionioi </em>(αἰώνιοι) which is actually a <em>plural </em>form of <em>aionios.&nbsp; </em>  </div>
<p>
    There are many, many more examples to look at that show that <em>aion</em>
    and its derivatives do not mean everlasting in most cases. Anyway, in order
    to finish writing this before the end of this <em>aion</em>, I will point
    you once again to some great resources that can help you learn more about
    this. Here is a list of several verses (with commentary) in the Septuagint
    that show that “eternal” or “forever” are poor choices in translation of
    the Hebrew concept of
    <em>
        olam:

<p>
    Now, let’s examine some uses in ancient extra-bibilical literature.
</p>
<h4>
    Uses of Aion and its Derivatives in Greek Literature and Other Sources
</h4>
<p>
    Finally, let’s examine uses of <em>aion</em> and it’s forms in other
    ancient Greek sources. This won’t be comprehensive but will clearly
    demonstrate the sense in which the ancient Greeks understood the words.
</p>
<p>
    In Homer’s <em>Iliad, </em>the father of Hector pleads with his son to not
    go out in battle against Achilles, begging him to enter the walls lest he
    “be deprived of pleasant <em>aionos (</em>life<em>),” (Iliad 22, 58). </em>
    From the context, it is clear that the word means “life.” Indeed this was a common way to use the word <em>aion</em>
    in ancient Greek literature.
</p>
<h3>
    Euripedes, Orestes, lines 971-981
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Oh, oh! you tribes of short-lived men, full of tears, full of suffering,
    see how fate runs counter to your hopes! All receive in turn their
different troubles in length of time; and the whole of mortal life (<em>aión) </em>is uncertain.” (<em>retrieved from
        <a
            href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0116%3Acard%3D971"
        >
            http://www.perseus.tufts.edu</a>)
    </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that the character Electra is clearly referring to life of limited
    duration, calling it “mortal.” The word <em>aion</em> does not denote
    eternity, but in this case is as short as the uncertain length of a
    lifespan.
</p>
<p>
    Both of the above are from several hundred years before Christ, so it could
    be argued that the meaning of the word changed by the time Jesus walked the
    earth.&nbsp; So, let’s look at the usage of these Greek words in a context near
    to the time of Christ.
</p>
<p>
    The historian Josephus (37-100 A.D.) lived a little after the time period
    of Jesus ministry in Palestine. He was Jewish, but was employed by the
    Roman Empire as a historian. As a Jewish man well-educated in Greek who
    lived shortly after the time of Christ, he clearly is a great resource to
    use to understand the meaning of the word <em>aionios </em>in both the
    Jewish and Greek mindsets. With this understanding, let’s examine his use
    of the word.
</p>
<h3>
    Josephus and <em>Aionios</em>
</h3>
<p>
    Referring to the imprisonment of one of the leaders of the Jewish rebellion
    (sometimes referred to as “John the tyrant”) Josephus says that he was
    “condemned to perpetual (<em>aionios</em>) imprisonment” (The War of the 
	Jews, Book VI).</p>
<p>
    This is obviously not an eternal imprisonment as the Romans had no such
    power to imprison people beyond death forever. At most, John suffered a
    life sentence, not an eternal one.
</p>
<div class="box">
    <em> </em>
    By the way, the complete text of the War of the Jews is available online
    here (You will find the reference above at the end of chapter 9):
    <a
        href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jews/Book_VI#Chapter_9"
    >
        <strong>
            The War of the Jews/Book VI Chapter 9
        </strong>
    </a>
</div>
<p>
    <em> </em>
    In chapter 3 of
    <em>
        Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of the Christian Church During
        Its First Five-Hundred Years</em>, J.W. Hanson accurately observes that Josephus uses the term in many other
    contexts (as well as the one discussed above) that are clearly temporary:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Josephus used the word <em>aionos</em> with its current meaning of limited
    duration. He applies it to the imprisonment of John the Tyrant; to Herod's
    reputation; to the glory acquired by soldiers; to the fame of an army as a
    "happy life and <em>aionian</em> glory." He used the words as do the
    Scriptures to denote limited duration, but when he would describe endless
    duration he uses different terms.
</blockquote>
<p>
So we can see clearly that Josephus, who came a little after Jesus used    <em>aion </em>and <em>aionios</em> to refer to ages and as descriptive of
    time periods of limited duration.
</p>
	<h4>
	Usage in Modern Greek</h4>
	<p>
	Now, just in case you are still not convinced that the terms    <em>aion </em>and <em>aionios </em>
	refer to ages and agelong periods, we will discuss modern usage.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	It is worth noting that the modern English term "eon" comes from the Greek    <em>aion.&nbsp; </em>
	An eon (in English) is a long span of time of indeterminate length.&nbsp; It 
	is, of course, silly to argue that English speakers altered the meaning of 
	the word but that the Greeks used it to mean eternity (since we've already 
	shown this to be false).&nbsp; The ancient Greeks also used it to denote 
	ages, as we have discussed.&nbsp; So, over 2000 years after the time of 
	Christ, we are still using the word in the same way that the ancient Greeks 
	did.&nbsp;&nbsp; This clearly supports the idea that an <em>aion </em>is, in 
	fact, an age. </p>
	<p>
	But there is a language that is much more closely tied to ancient Greek than 
	English.&nbsp;&nbsp; That language, unsurprisingly, is <em>modern</em> Greek.&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
	it turns out, modern Greek also uses the term    <em>aion </em>in the same 
	way as ancient Greek.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can look this up for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Here is the word    <em>aion </em>in Greek letters: αιων (copy and paste it into 
	the very handy 
	<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=greek+to+english&amp;rlz=1C1CHZL_enUS667US667&amp;oq=greek+to+e&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j69i57j69i60l2j0.4192j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google 
	Translate</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	You will notice that the first definition that pops up is "<em>years</em>" 
	and if you look at the other definitions you will see "eon" and its British 
	spelling "aeon."&nbsp;&nbsp; Nary a whisper of eternity.</p>
	<p>
	Now you may be thinking that    <em>aion </em>obviously means an age or time 
	period or even simply <em>years</em>.&nbsp; But the word translated as 
	eternal is typically    <em>aionios, </em>not    <em>aion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
	So now let's examine    <em>aionios</em> in modern Greek.</p>
	<p>We can use the same process to look up 
	<em>aionios</em> in modern Greek.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here it is: αιωνιος.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Now if you paste this into Google Translate, you see that there are several 
	definitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eternal is one of them, but we also see "agelong," 
	"timeless," and "undying" among others.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we look to confirm 
	our findings in other Greek to English dictionaries, we find confirmation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Here is one example:</p>
	<blockquote>αιώνιος [eoːnios] <em>adj</em> <br>age-old (struggle etc.), age-long, eternal, everlasting, perpetual, perdurable, perennial (problems etc.)<br>(<a href="https://www.dict.com/?t=en&amp;set=_gren&amp;w=%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82">dict.com</a>)</blockquote>
	<p>
    We see that this dictionary rightly begins with the more literal 
	translations of the word (age-old and age-long).&nbsp; Now you may object 
	that I have no basis for claiming these to be more literal, but your 
	objection would be unfounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well known that 
	<em>aionios</em> is an adjective derived from the noun 
	<em>aion</em>.&nbsp; There is no debate about that fact.&nbsp; With that in 
	mind consider the following linguistic concept, well summarized below by 
	Luke Kessler:</p>
	<blockquote>

    <p class= center style="font-size:x-small"> (<a href="http://makepeacewithjesus.org/4-scholars">What Biblical Scholars Say about the Word “Aionios”</a>)</p>
	<p>It seems like his English professors were meaner than mine, but the principle is valid.  Let's consider a few other examples of adjectives that are derived from nouns to confirm. 
	<em>&nbsp;Worldly </em>means of the world, not of the universe, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<em>Mathematical </em>means related to mathematics, not to every other type 
	of knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Beautiful</em> describes beauty and nothing 
	can be more beautiful than the beauty it has.&nbsp; An activity can't be any 
	more <em>dangerous</em> than the dangers inherent to it.&nbsp; In all of 
	these cases (and I surmise in virtually every case), the adjective is 
	limited by the noun from which it comes.&nbsp; The same is true of the 
	relationship of the adjective <em>aionios</em> to the noun <em>aion</em>. </p>
	<p>I believe the sum of the evidence thus far should convince a rational, 
	unbiased person that <em>aionios</em> does not necessarily mean eternal or 
	everlasting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone tells you that it simply must mean 
	eternal, based on authority rather than clear evidence, you should be wary.&nbsp; 
	Such a tactic is not reason, but manipulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>
    Was There a Greek Word that Always Meant Eternal?
</h2>
<p>
    Some will still contend that the word <em>aionios</em> still means eternal
    because it was the only Greek word that could have been used to denote the
    concept of endlessness. So, it is argued, Jesus and his disciples couldn’t
have chosen a more precise word, and therefore the somewhat vague    <em>aionios </em>was chosen as the only option. But this is not true.
</p>
<p>
Indeed there were Greek words that clearly denoted endlessness,    <em>aidion, aidios, </em>and <em>athanaton</em>. But Jesus and his
    disciples <em>never used </em>them to describe punishment. Instead, they
    were described by Josephus as being used by the Pharisees and Essenes (who
    believed in eternal imprisonment and torment).
</p>
<p>
    Once again, let’s look at a short passage from
    <em>
        Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of the Christian Church During
        Its First Five-Hundred Years</em>.&nbsp; In it, J.W. Hanson quotes Josephus:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "They [the Pharisees] believe that wicked spirits are to be kept in an
    eternal imprisonment (<em>eirgmon aidion</em>). The Pharisees say all souls
    are incorruptible, but while those of good men are removed into other
bodies those of bad men are subject to eternal punishment" (<em>aidios timoria</em>). Elsewhere he says that the Essenes, "allot to bad
souls a dark, tempestuous place, full of never-ceasing torment (<em>timoria adialeipton</em>), where they suffer a deathless torment" (<em>athanaton timorion</em>). <em>Aidion </em>and <em>athanaton </em>are
    his favorite terms for duration, and <em>timoria </em>(torment) for
    punishment (retrieved from
    <a href="http://www.tentmaker.org/books/prevailing/upd3.html">
       Hanson</a>).
</blockquote>
<p>
    We can independently confirm this by looking at Josephus' writings on our
    own, which are available online for anyone to see. For example:
</p>
<h3>
    Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVIII
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now for the Pharisees…They also believe that souls have an immortal vigour
    in them: and that under the earth there will be rewards, or punishments;
    according as they have lived virtuously or viciously in this life: and the
latter are to be detained in an <strong>everlasting prison (<em>eirgmon aidion</em>)</strong>; but that the former shall have power to revive
    and live again. On account of which doctrines they are able greatly to
    persuade the body of the people: and whatsoever they do about divine
    worship, prayers, and sacrifices, they perform them according to their
    direction.
</blockquote>
<p class="center" style="font-size:x-small">(retrieved from 
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-18.html">http://penelope.uchicago.edu</a>) </p>
<p>
    So it can be seen that the word used by the Pharisees to describe
    endlessness was different than <em>aionios</em>. According to Josephus,
they described the punishment of the wicked as    <strong>εἱργμός ἀίδιος (</strong>transliterated<strong> </strong><em>eirgmon aidion</em>),
    with the word <em>eirgmon</em> meaning “prison” and <em>aidion</em> meaning
    “everlasting.” Now, it is no secret that Jesus was <em>not</em> a huge fan
    of the Pharisees. Is it surprising then that He used different terminology
    to describe judgment in order to contradict the false pharisaical doctrine?
</p>
<p>
    Jesus clearly knew about the doctrine of the Pharisees but he purposely
    chose to use the term <em>aiōnion kolasin</em>. We have already discussed
that <em>aiōnion</em> refers to a limited time period. The word    <em>kolasin</em> is also interesting as it connotes corrective discipline,
    not vindictive retribution. As Plato says, “he who desires to inflict
    rational punishment (<em>kolazein</em>) does not retaliate for a past wrong
    which cannot be undone; he has regard to the future, and is desirous that
    the man who is punished, and he who sees him punished, may be deterred from
    doing wrong again. He punishes (<em>kolazei</em>) for the sake of
    prevention, thereby clearly implying that virtue is capable of being
taught” (<em>Protagoras</em> as translated by Benjamin Jowett<strong>, </strong>retrieved from
    <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1591/1591-h/1591-h.htm">
        http://www.gutenberg.org
    </a>
    ).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Kolazei </em>
    and <em>kolasin </em>are related, with <em>kolazei</em> being the verb form
of the word. This shows that Plato clearly understood punishment (<em>kolasin/kolazei</em>) to be corrective, for the purpose of reforming
    individuals and deterring from evil behavior. And this is the word that
Jesus chose to employ, not torment (<em>timoria</em>) or prison (<em>eirgmon</em>) as used by the Essenes and Pharisees respectively. It is
    clear from Jesus’ diction that the judgment He is describing is temporary
    purposeful correction that is designed to lead people to righteousness, in
    contrast to the vindictive retribution described by his contemporaries.

<h2>
    <u>What about “Everlasting” in the Old Testament?</u>
</h2>
<p>
    So far we have only been looking that the use of words translated
    “eternal”, “everlasting”, and “forever” in the New Testament. Since the Old
    Testament was written in Hebrew, we know that the word aiónios was not
    being used. Let’s do a word study on a very important passage about
    judgment where the Hebrew is translated as “everlasting.”
</p>
<h3>
    Daniel 12:2
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to
    everlasting life, but the others to disgrace <em>and</em> everlasting
    contempt.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, let’s examine the meaning of the original Hebrew using the NASB
    Lexicon:
    <a href="lexiconDaniel12.jpg">
    <img alt="Daniel 12:2 lexicon" src="lexiconDaniel12.jpg" class="auto-style1"></a>
    
    <p class="center" style="font-size:x-small">(retrieved from
<a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/daniel/12-2.htm">
    Daniel/12-2.htm</a>)
    </p>
  <p>Notice the meaning of the Hebrew word translated “everlasting” (עֹולָֽם׃ or o•v•lam.).   It means long duration, antiquity, or futurity, NOT everlasting.&nbsp; 
  This same word is used throughout the Old Testament in contexts that 
  conclusively show that limited duration is meant.&nbsp; In fact, all of the examples that were mentioned in the discussion of the Septuagint above use <em>ovlam/olam </em> in the original Hebrew to denote past events that have ended (Jonah's "forever" time in the 
  fish, ancient ruins, the smoke rising from Edom etc.)&nbsp; There are too many 
  examples to list, so I will end with a list some resources that you can access 
  to continue your investigation into the usage of both the ancient Greek and 
  ancient Hebrew used in the original Biblical texts.
