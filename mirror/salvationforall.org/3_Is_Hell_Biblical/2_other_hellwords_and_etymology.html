<h2>
    Other words that are mistakenly interpreted as hell
</h2>
<p>
    There are two other words that are sometimes mistakenly thought to refer to
    a “hell” of eternal punishment. One is the Hebrew term <em>Sheol</em> and
    the other is the Greek term <em>Hades</em>. In fact, in the 1611 version of
    the King James Bible, both <em>Sheol </em>and <em>Hades </em>were sometimes
    translated as “hell.” No modern translation, however, adopted this
    translation, because it is obviously incorrect.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Sheol </em>
    and <em>Hades</em> were synonymous terms biblically as the Septuagint (the
    Greek translation of the Old Testament completed in the second century
    B.C.) translates <em>Sheol</em> as <em>Hades.</em> This demonstrates that
    they were viewed to refer to the same place conceptually: the grave or
    death, which was viewed as an unknown place of some mystery in the ancient
    Hebrew mindset.
</p>
<p>
    At any rate, there are more detailed descriptions regarding <em>Sheol</em>
    and <em>Hades</em>. One thorough examination is found here:
    <a href="http://makepeacewithjesus.org/14-sheol-part-1">
        Sheol Part 1
    </a>
    and in subsequent articles. They are worth the read.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I will briefly summarize the most important reasons why    <em>Sheol </em>and <em>Hades</em> cannot possibly refer to a hell of
    endless torment:
</p>
<p>
    Reason #1: Everybody goes there, both righteous and wicked. There are many
    references indicating that the righteous will go to <em>Sheol</em> or the
    grave. Here are a few:
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 89:46-48
</h3>
<blockquote>
    How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?
    <br/>
    How long will your wrath burn like fire?
    <br/>
    Remember how short my time is!
    <br/>
    For what vanity you have created all the children of man!
    <br/>
    What man can live and never see death?
    <br/>
    Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
</blockquote>
<p>
    <em>Sheol </em>
    refers to the place of the dead, and none of us can avoid it.
Interestingly, the psalmist asks who can deliver the soul from    <em>Sheol</em>. At the time, he was implying that nobody could because
    he didn’t know who had the keys to death, but we do: Jesus Christ!
</p>
<h3>
    Ecclesiastes 9:2,10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    It is the same for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the
    wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who
    offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice…
<br>
    Whatever your hand finds to do, do <em>it</em> with <em>all</em> your
might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in    <em>Sheol</em> where you are going.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that both the righteous and the wicked go to <em>Sheol</em>. We all
    have this same fate, which is incompatible with <em>Sheol</em> referring to
    an endless hell.
</p>
<h3>
    Job 14:13
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Oh that You would hide me in Sheol,
    <br/>
    That You would conceal me until Your wrath returns <em>to You</em>,
    <br/>
    That You would set a limit for me and remember me!
</blockquote>
<p>
    In this passage Job is asking to die and go to <em>Sheol</em> out of his
    desperation. This clearly makes no sense if he is referring to a place of
    eternal torment.
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 88:1-5
</h3>
<blockquote>
    O Lord, the God of my salvation,
    <br/>
    I have cried out by day and in the night before You.
    <br>Let my prayer come before You;
    <br/>
    Incline Your ear to my cry!
    <br>For my soul has
    had enough troubles,
    <br/>
    And my life has drawn near to Sheol.
    <br/>
    I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit;
    <br/>
    I have become like a man without strength,
    <br/>
    Forsaken among the dead,
    <br/>
    Like the slain who lie in the grave,
    <br/>
    Whom You remember no more,
    <br/>
    And they are cut off from Your hand.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Psalm 89:48
</h3>
<blockquote>
    What man can live and not see death?
    <br/>
    Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
</blockquote>
<p>
    2. It is clearly indicated that people can be saved from <em>Sheol</em> and
    that God is there. It is clearly not permanent.
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 139:7-8
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Where can I go from Your Spirit?
    <br/>
    Or where can I flee from Your presence?
<br>
    If I ascend to heaven, You are there;
    <br/>
    If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Samuel 2:6 (part of Hannah’s prayer)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The Lord kills and makes alive;
    <br/>
    He brings down to Sheol and raises up.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Psalm 16:10-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol;
    <br/>
    Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.
    <br/>
    You will make known to me the path of life;
    <br/>
    In Your presence is fullness of joy;
    <br/>
    In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.
</blockquote>
<h2>
    Etymology of the word “hell”
</h2>
<p>
    One final point to make regarding the word “hell” is that it is an
    unnecessary and misleading translation of the name of a literal place, the
    Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna), physically located outside of Jerusalem. It is
    less of a translation than a boldfaced <em>replacement</em> of a proper
    noun with a different, unrelated proper noun, like replacing Los Angeles or
    New York with “hell” (no offense to either city as I’m just giving examples
    of places most people have heard of). Perhaps this is why no other books in
    the New Testament besides those in which Jewish audiences (familiar with
    Jerusalem’s geography) are being addressed, use the word. Most people in
    Rome or Corinth would have no idea about the name of Jerusalem’s city dump.
</p>
<p>
    So where does the word “hell” even come from? It is important to note that
    it is not an Aramaic word (Jesus likely spoke Aramaic to his audiences),
    nor a Hebrew word (the Old Testament was written in Hebrew), nor a Greek
    word (the New Testament was written in Greek). So the word “hell” was
    certainly not used in the original languages.
</p>
<p>
    Instead the word “hell” likely is derived from Norse mythology (think Thor,
    Loki, and Odin) or earlier pagan concepts of the people groups from which
    Germanic languages such as English and Old Norse, originated. Here, the
    etymology of the word is described:
</p>
<blockquote>

    <a
        href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0"
    >
        <strong>hell (n.)</strong>
    </a>

<br>
    also <em>Hell</em>, Old English <em>hel</em>, <em>helle</em>, "nether
    world, abode of the dead, infernal regions, place of torment for the wicked
    after death," from Proto-Germanic <em>*haljo</em> "the underworld" (source
also of Old Frisian <em>helle</em>, Old Saxon <em>hellia</em>, Dutch<em>hel</em>, Old Norse <em>hel</em>, German <em>Hölle</em>, Gothic<em>halja</em> "hell"). Literally "concealed place" (compare Old Norse    <em>hellir</em> "cave, cavern"), from PIE root
    <a
        href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=*kel-%20(1)&amp;allowed_in_frame=0"
    >
        <strong><em>*kel- (1)</em></strong>
    </a>
    "to cover, conceal, save."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The English word may be in part from Old Norse mythological <em>Hel</em>
    (from Proto-Germanic <em>*halija</em> "one who covers up or hides
    something"), in Norse mythology the name of Loki's daughter who rules over
    the evil dead in <em>Niflheim</em>, the lowest of all worlds (<em>nifl</em>
    "mist"). A pagan concept and word fitted to a Christian idiom. In Middle
    English, also of the <em>Limbus Patrum</em>, place where the Patriarchs,
    Prophets, etc. awaited the Atonement. Used in the KJV for Old Testament
Hebrew <em>Sheol</em> and New Testament Greek <em>Hades</em>,    <em>Gehenna</em>. Used figuratively for "state of misery, any bad
    experience" since at least late 14c. As an expression of disgust, etc.,
    first recorded 1670s.
</blockquote>

    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    So the word “hell” is a word derived from Proto-Germanic paganism. It is
    the hidden or concealed underworld, co-opted by translators to make the
    Valley of Hinnom a relatable place. Unfortunately, it was relatable but
    very misleading. There is no reason to translate the Valley of Hinnom to
    “whatever your pagan underworld happens to be.” This obviously allows for
    an increased influence of demonstrably false pagan doctrine that is
    contrary to the Bible. Using known pagan terminology to describe the
    afterlife would have clearly encouraged the infiltration of associated
    cultural biases into Christianity. This is, in fact, exactly what appears
    to have occurred, leading the church to an understanding of God’s judgment
    that is not supported by the Biblical text.

    So now that we have a better understanding of the word "hell", we must 
	consider the contexts in which it is used.&nbsp; In the next chapter, we 
	will examine every use by Jesus of the word <em>Gehenna</em> (which is 
	mistranslated as "hell" in many English versions of the Bible) in its 
	original context.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we do this, it will become quite evident 
	that Jesus <em>never</em> used the term to denote a place of eternal 
	suffering for unbelievers.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't believe me, you had 
	better read on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
