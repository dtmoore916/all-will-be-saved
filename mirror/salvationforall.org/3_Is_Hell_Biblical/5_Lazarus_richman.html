<h1>
    Parables and Sayings about Hell?
</h1>
<p>
    It is likely at this point that many people are still thinking that I’m
    leaving out important texts that prove the doctrine of hell. What about the
    parables and sayings that suggest punishment of the wicked?
</p>
<p>
    Now, it is important to remind you that I am not arguing against
    punishment. Rather, I am arguing against the doctrine of endless,
    vindictive, purposeless punishment. With that in mind, let’s look at some
    of the parables and sayings that are often traditionally associated with
    this doctrine.
</p>
<h4>
    Lazarus and the Rich Man
</h4>
<p>
    This is one of the most often cited parables as a purported proof text for
    endless punishment. It is therefore very important to examine this text to
    determine if it is actually supportive of the doctrine. Let’s take a look:
</p>
<h3>
    Luke 16:19-31
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
    “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in
    luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with
    sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs
    came and licked his sores.
</p>
<p>
    “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s
    side. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in
    torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
    So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to
    dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in
    agony in this fire.’
</p>
<p>
    “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received
    your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is
    comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and
    you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from
    here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’
</p>
<p>
    “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I
    have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to
    this place of torment.’
</p>
<p>
    “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to
    them.’
</p>
<p>
    “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them,
    they will repent.’
</p>
<p>
    “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they
    will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are many interesting points to make regarding this parable, but as a
    matter of first importance it is critical to understand that this is
    absolutely NOT a proof text for hell! Let’s see why.
</p>
<p>
    First, it must be noticed that the place in which both the rich man and
Lazarus are found is <em>Hades</em>, not hell (<em>Gehenna</em> or    <em>Tartaros</em>). As we have discussed previously, <em>Hades</em> is the
    Greek term that was used to translate the Hebrew <em>Sheol</em>, where both
    the righteous and unrighteous went in death. Now we can see that the
    experience in <em>Hades </em>is quite different for the righteous and the
    unrighteous, with Lazarus being comforted by Abraham while the rich man is
    in agony.
</p>
<p>
    If you still doubt that both characters are in Hades, consider the fact
    that the rich man can clearly see Lazarus and speak with Abraham, though
    from a great distance. This distance is clearly not so great as to prevent
    the rich man from being able to identify Lazarus, or prevent a detailed
    conversation between Abraham and the rich man (with no implied shouting).
</p>
<p>
    Second, it must be noted that the characters in the parable die and go
    immediately to <em>Hades</em>. There is no bodily resurrection and no
    judgment by Christ prior to entry into <em>Hades</em>. Other people,
    including the rich man’s brothers, are clearly still alive and doing their
    business on earth. All of this is in stark contrast to the idea of final
    judgment after the resurrection of all people as described in Revelation.
</p>
<p>
    Third, there are only two people (besides Abraham) represented in the
    story, suggesting that the parable is likely representing a deeper truth.
    In other words, it may not really be about two individuals but rather what
    they symbolically represent. It has been argued that the symbolism used
    suggests that the rich man represented the Jewish nation who had been
    granted a spiritual feast, but they would not share with the Gentiles who
    were denied even the scraps that fell from the table. An interesting
    exposition of this point can be found here:
    <em>
        <a href="http://mercifultruth.com/lazarus.html">
            An Examination of Lazarus and the Rich Man
        </a>
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    As a brief summary, here are a couple possible symbols that the author
    makes note of:
</p>
<p>
    1. linen and purple that clothed the rich man could represent the
    priesthood and royalty of the Jews.
</p>
<p>
    2. Lazarus and the dogs were outside the gate. The Jewish leaders of Jesus’
    day did not associate with Gentiles and other outsiders at all, and in fact
    referred to them as “dogs.”
</p>
<p>
    For further details, feel free to read the paper. It is quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
    Fourth, the “great chasm” between Lazarus and the rich man could easily be
    the fact that the rich man shows no repentance for his mistreatment of
    Lazarus. Instead, he still shows contempt for Lazarus, indicating that he
    still thinks of him as an inferior servant. He does not even speak to him
    directly, but asks Abraham to “send Lazarus” to fetch water for him and to
    go act as his messenger to his extant brothers.
</p>
<p>
    Also, <em>if</em> you take the view that Lazarus and the rich man represent
    the Gentiles and Jews, the great chasm could be referring to the fact that
    most of the Jewish nation rejected Jesus as Messiah, experiencing “a
    hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in”
    (Romans 11:25).
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of how it is interpreted, there is no mention whatsoever of
    duration, much less eternity. Instead, we see that in <em>Hades</em> or the
    grave there is no way to cross over. This seems to be reserved for a later
    date, after judgment is complete.
</p>
	<p>
    Another important observation regarding this parable is the fact that Jesus 
	frequently condemned a lack of compassion and love for people.&nbsp; This is 
	certainly a key concept in the parable as it is the only implicit reason for 
	why the rich man is in the rough part of <em>Hades</em>.&nbsp; So if we take 
	nothing else away from the parable, we should at least notice the importance 
	of showing compassion toward others. </p>
<p>
    Finally, we see another purpose of the parable. Jesus uses the opportunity
    to indirectly prophesy about his own resurrection, saying that “if they do
    not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if
    someone rises from the dead.” This seems to foreshadow his own
    resurrection. And we know that many people did not believe, even though he
    rose from the dead. In fact, it is clear that the religious leaders who had
    him executed, actively covered up the resurrection as stated in Matthew
    28:11-15:
</p>
<blockquote>
    While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city
    and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the
    chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the
    soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, “You are to say, ‘His
    disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
    If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out
    of trouble.” So the soldiers took the money and did as they were
    instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to
    this very day.
</blockquote>
<p>
    So we can reasonably conclude that the parable of Lazarus and the rich man
    is not a compelling proof text for the doctrine of hell since it actually 
	does not
    discuss “hell” at all.&nbsp; Instead, it teaches us many other truths.</p><br>
