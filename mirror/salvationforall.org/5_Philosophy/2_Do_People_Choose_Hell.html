<h1>
    Do People Choose Hell?
</h1>
<p>
    Because the traditional doctrine of hell generates such a visceral response
    of moral revulsion in most people, there have been many attempts made to
    make the doctrine feel more morally acceptable. One such attempt is
    claiming that people choose to go to hell of their own free will. Consider
    the following from C.S. Lewis.
</p>
<h3>
    C.S. Lewis, The Great Divorce
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, "Thy
    will be done," and those to whom God says, in the end, "Thy will be done."
    All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no
    Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it.
    Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, it must be said that I like C.S. Lewis. He wrote many things that
    showed deep thinking about the Christian faith and that are helpful
    expositions of Christian thought. The quote above, however, just isn’t one
    of them. Why do I say this?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is that there are numerous scriptural and philosophical problems
    with his statement. Let’s examine them.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is apparent from Scripture that those who are being punished by
    God are <em>cast</em> into the lake of fire at the final judgment. They
    don’t walk in of their own free will. The imagery of <em>Gehenna</em> is
    the same. There is never any sense in the Scriptures that people choose it.
    In fact, if we are to take the parables of Matthew 25 on the subject, we
    see that the unprepared virgins came to the door late and said, “‘Lord,
    Lord,… open the door for us!’” But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t
know you’” (Matthew 25: 11-12). It is the same of the wicked servant who    <strong><sup> </sup></strong>is <em>thrown</em> “outside, into the
    darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (Matthew
25:30). Likewise, the goats in the parable of the sheep and the goats are    <em>commanded to depart</em> from Christ (Matthew 25:41). There is simply
    no scriptural support that people choose hell.
</p>
<p>
    Yet Lewis makes this claim repeatedly. Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    C.S. Lewis <em>The Problem of Pain</em>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels
    to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, there is no scriptural support for this claim.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; In fact, we are
    told who has the keys and the authority over all things: Christ himself.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 1:18
</h3>
<blockquote>
    I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and
    ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
</blockquote>
<p>
    And
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 28:17-18
</h3>
<blockquote>
    When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to
    them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is Jesus who holds the keys to <em>death</em> and Hades. You may recall
that the final place of judgment for the wicked is called the second    <em>death</em>. <em>He</em> holds the keys. <em>He</em> holds all authority
    over everything. Saying that people have the keys to hell and that we lock
    ourselves in has no biblical support at all.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    It also is wholly
    unreasonable.
</p>
<p>
    I think it is a verifiable fact that <em>nobody</em> wants to be tormented
    forever. Hell advocates love to say that hell is eternal, conscious
    torment. Would people really see God on judgment day and choose this over
    Him? Shall we take a survey? We can make it quite simple. Here is a sample
    of what this survey could look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
    Survey Question: Which would you rather experience? Choose one of the
    following:
<br>
<br>
    Option A: Eternal happiness with a good, majestic God who loves you more
    than you can possibly imagine.
<br>
<br>
    Option B: Eternal conscious torment in hell. In other words, absolute
    misery forever and ever.

</blockquote>
<p>
    Nobody would really choose option B.&nbsp; It is incredibly absurd to insist that
    most people on earth would.&nbsp; If the survey were actually given, some people
    might do so sarcastically, in order to mock the survey, but no one actually
    wants to be tormented, especially not forever.
</p>
<p>
    This brings up another highly problematic aspect of this view. Remember
    that all people will appear before God at judgment. Consider the scene:
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 20:11-12
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and
    the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. And I
    saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
    opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were
    judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, everyone will see our judge on a glorious white throne and his majesty
    will be so impressive that even the earth and the heavens will flee from
    Him. I can’t even imagine what that means, but it certainly suggests
    greatness beyond comprehension.
</p>
<p>
    The notion that people see God face to face in this way and still choose
    hell, however, suggests that God’s majesty isn’t very impressive. It
    suggests that a person’s response upon seeing God at judgment is “well, I
    guess that’s God but I’m not too impressed. I’d rather go to hell so I can
    be a self-centered jerk for all eternity.” Is God really not impressive
    enough, not great enough and not powerful enough to generate repentance in
    our souls? Will people really see Him and choose eternal conscious torment
    in hell? Really? This makes God out to be pathetically weak and
    unappealing. This is not a biblical view of God. Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 104:1-4
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Bless the Lord, O my soul!
    <br/>
    O Lord my God, You are very great;
    <br/>
    You are clothed with splendor and majesty,
    <br/>
    Covering Yourself with light as with a cloak,
    <br/>
    Stretching out heaven like a tent curtain.
    <br/>
    He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters;
    <br/>
    He makes the clouds His chariot;
    <br/>
    He walks upon the wings of the wind;
    <br/>
    He makes the winds His messengers,
<br/>
    Flaming fire His ministers.
	</blockquote>

<h3>
    <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Exodus/15/11">Exodus 15:11</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    "Who is like You among the gods, O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in
    holiness, Awesome in praises, working wonders?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Is God so feeble that we won’t be impressed enough to choose Him? The Bible
    makes it clear that this view of God is mistaken. We will be absolutely
    blown away by His awesome majesty! His power, goodness and light will be
    overwhelming and irresistible. There is simply no way that people will see
    God at judgment and choose to walk into the lake of fire. They won’t see
    God, shrug, and say “meh, where can I sign up for that second death bit?
    That sounds more like my cup of tea.” The very notion is incredibly
    ridiculous. And it makes God sound like He isn’t very captivating,
    forgetting that He is the most spectacular Being that has ever existed.
</p>
<p>
    Yet this view has had a significant impact on many Christians, so much so
    that many forget that it has no biblical basis. It is a way that people
    make themselves feel better about eternal hell, so people cling to it.
    After all, something must be said to sooth our consciences.&nbsp; If people are
    just choosing eternal torment of their own free will, we can feel then that
    it isn’t so bad, right? For this reason the concept that people choose
    eternal suffering has become ingrained in our imaginations. Because of
    this, it is important to further examine the philosophical assumptions of
    this argument and test them against Scripture and reason. So let’s take a
    look at another angle of this argument next:
</p>
<h3>
    G.K. Chesterton
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Hell is God’s great compliment to the reality of human freedom and the
    dignity of human choice.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the above quote, Chesterton takes the concept that people choose hell a
    bit further, suggesting that it is, in a sense, an ethically superior thing
    for God to allow this choice because it honors human dignity and our
    ability to choose for ourselves. Again, there are serious flaws in this
    line of reasoning.
</p>
<p>
    First, does the hell doctrine really honor human freedom? Consider the fact
    that the doctrine says that people are cast into hell where they experience
    endless torment and are never allowed out, for any reason. This is clearly
    the opposite of freedom. It’s like being tossed in a medieval dungeon where
    you will be tortured for the rest of your life. And the traditional
    doctrine prohibits the possibility that you could choose God from your
    location in hell, even if you really wanted to. Once there, you have no
    more choices at all. Saying that this honors your freedom is ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
    Second, I cannot think of any doctrine that could possibly be more
    manipulative and coercive than the threat of eternal punishment for not
    believing something properly. In what possible sense does it honor freedom
    to say “if you don’t believe and do what I tell you, I’m going to torture
    you! And by the way, I’ll torture you forever in the most awful way
    imaginable! Now go be free and do what you want…" It is like a gun is being
    held to your head, and your assailant is telling you to make a choice, but
    if you choose wrong, he’ll pull the trigger.&nbsp; In what sense is freedom
    present in this situation?&nbsp; How is the “dignity of human choice” preserved?
    It is quite ironic that proponents of the traditional hell doctrine claim
    that it honors free will; nothing could be further from the truth.
</p>
<p>
    Third, the assumption being made by Chesterton in this statement is that
    free will is a moral good that surpasses all others. His argument makes
    free will into an almost ultimate good. I say this because it trumps all
    other ethical considerations. For example, we could list some ethical
    problems with hell:
</p>
<p>
    1. Torturing people for no purpose is morally wrong.
</p>
<p>
    2. Torturing people who never heard the gospel is unfair.
</p>
<p>
    3. Torturing people forever is worse than anything any madman has ever done
    in all of history.
</p>
<p>
    …etc.
</p>
<p>
    But Chesterton’s argument says all of those things are OK because choice is
    being honored. Given the terrible nature of this fate, why wouldn’t God be
    morally obligated to make Himself known in such way that everyone could be
    reconciled to Him? If God is our Heavenly Father, as the Bible claims
    repeatedly, why would He let His children end up eternally lost?
    Chesterton’s answer is free will. He is just honoring our choices.
</p>
<p>
    The problem with this is that allowing people to choose whatever they want
    is not actually an ethical good. As a father myself, I do not let my
    children choose to eat only candy and ride their bikes on the freeway just
    because that is what they want to do. That would be considered neglect. As
    a parent you want to help your children grow up into mature adults and you
    restrict freedom when necessary because <em>their ultimate well-being</em>
    is more important. Since God is our Heavenly Father, He too wants what is
    best for us. Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 7:11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your
    children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those
    who ask him!
   
</blockquote>
<p>
    God is a good, good Father. He wants what is best for His children. Though
    He allows us to make choices and make mistakes, “he is not far from any one
    of us” (Acts 17:27). In fact, we are told that our free will and subsequent
    disobedience compliments God’s purpose, “for God has consigned all to
    disobedience, that he may have mercy on all” (Romans 11:32). Therefore, our
    choices aren’t honored by sending us to hell, but rather by being a tool
    that God uses to further magnify his amazing mercy.
</p>
<p>
    “God’s great compliment to the reality of human freedom and the dignity of
    human choice” isn’t hell, but grace, for “where sin increased, grace
    abounded all the more” (Romans 5:20). In spite of our awful decisions, God
    is gracious to us and shows us mercy, even when he disciplines us as a
    Father rightly should. This truly honors human dignity and freedom.
</p>
<h4>
    How Much Choice Do We Really Have?
</h4>
<p>
    Now let’s consider one more aspect of the “people choose hell” argument.
    For all the talk of human choice in this view, a huge amount of what we
    experience in life has nothing to do with our choices at all. And these
    experiences powerfully shape our psychology and our decisions. For example,
    nobody chooses where they are born. Yet, if you are born in certain places
    in the world, you are virtually guaranteed to never hear the gospel, while
    in other places it is readily available. You don’t choose your parents or
    your influences. You don’t choose to be abused and experience the
    psychological baggage and trust issues that come along with such treatment.
    Yet these experiences profoundly affect who you are and how you feel about
    God and the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    But it isn’t just experiences that you don’t choose. You also have no
    choice about your genetic makeup or your health. You have no choice about
    being born with a neurodegenerative disease like Tay-Sachs that slowly robs
    you of brain function and kills you during childhood. And you don’t choose
    whether your child inherits a disease like that. But all of these things
    affect a person’s perceptions about the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    The Bible also disagrees with the notion that we choose to follow God.  Paul, referencing Psalm 14, Psalm 53 and Ecclesiastes 7, clearly claims
    that no one chooses God, but instead that all are "under the power of sin" which makes us powerless to choose rightly of our own accord. 
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 3:9-12
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all
    under the power of sin. As it is written:

<br>
    “There is no one righteous, not even one;
<br>
    there is no one who understands;
    <br/>
    there is no one who seeks God.

<br>
    All have turned away,
    <br/>
    they have together become worthless;
    <br/>
    there is no one who does good,
    <br/>
    not even one.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    The clear implication here is that we don't choose God but rather that he 
	chooses to love us.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Jesus Himself elucidates this 
	further when speaking to his disciples, saying" You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you. This is my command: Love each other" 
	(John 15:16-17).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent that Christ chooses us<em> so 
	that we can show His love to others and bear fruit.</em>&nbsp; We are not 
	chosen to be an exclusive, reclusive group, but rather to serve as His 
	ambassadors that bring others into His kingdom, which will only be complete 
	"when the times reach their fulfillment" and He brings "unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ" (Ephesians 1:10).
</p>
	<p>
    The great fallacy of the Christian who assumes superiority over others who 
	don’t come to know God in this life is thinking that our belief is because 
	we are good, and other people aren’t, ignoring the fact that we believe 
	purely by grace. Your life was different from other people’s lives in a way 
	that allowed you to come to faith. We have no right to judge the reasons why 
	other people have not come to faith yet. Claiming that it is because they 
	“chose” the road to perdition is arrogant, myopic and uninformed. In what 
	sense do infants choose to be raised in an Islamic country where 
	Christianity is illegal, or become orphaned and have to raise themselves on
    the streets of Calcutta? If they do not hear the gospel, or do not
    understand it because of their circumstances, does this mean that they are
    choosing hell?&nbsp; Of course not.
</p>
<p>
    Choosing to claim that “they” are all wicked and want to rule themselves
    ignores the plain fact that “we” too are wicked and want to rule ourselves.
    Saying that “they” will never learn to submit to God overlooks that “we”
    are still learning this very thing. And pretending that “we” chose God
    neglects the reality that He “chose us in him before the creation of the
    world…” (Ephesians 1:4).
</p>
<p>
    Freedom of choice is not the ethic that drives the gospel. Instead it is
    driven by a love far greater than we can imagine, by a grace that we don’t
    deserve, and by a justice that redeems the unredeemable through whatever
    means our all-knowing God knows to be necessary.
