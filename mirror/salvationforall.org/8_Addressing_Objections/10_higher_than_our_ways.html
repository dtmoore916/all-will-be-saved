<h1>
    Addressing Objections: His Ways are Higher than Our Ways
</h1>
<p>
    Many Christians readily admit that they do not understand the doctrine of
    hell, that it grates on their ideas of morality, and seems difficult to
    reconcile with their understanding of who God is. It doesn’t jive with
    their consciences and makes them uncomfortable, even miserable at times.
    Yet they feel compelled to believe it anyways because they have been told
    that it is <em>the</em> biblical view, and if God’s word says it to be so,
    it must be so.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully by now you have seen that the salvation of all people is a
    biblical view with tremendous support from the actual biblical texts.
    Hopefully you see that you, at the very least, have an option to trust the
    abundant scriptural evidence that backs up God’s undying love for all of
    humanity and His ability to accomplish His will to save. But in case you
    are still thinking that you must cling to the other view, we must address
    the objection that hell advocates like to bring up when people have doubts
    about the doctrine of hell.
</p>
<p>
    They will say that if you doubt their interpretation of hell that you are
    doubting the Bible itself. They will say that you are putting yourself in
    God’s place by thinking (presumably in opposition to God) that eternal hell
    is morally wrong. After all, doesn’t God have the right to do as he
    pleases? Aren’t His ways higher than your ways? Who are you to question
    Him? This is what they will say, and if you are easily intimidated, you
    will ignore your conscience yet again, and put your brain back to sleep.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t let that be you.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, be like the Berean Jews who were commended in Acts 17:11-12 for
    diligently searching the Scriptures to determine if the things Paul was
    preaching were true. Let’s diligently search the Scriptures together now.
</p>
<p>
    First, let’s begin by showing a verse that hellfire advocates cite to
    accuse people of opposing the higher ways of God if they doubt the hell
    doctrine’s veracity.
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 55:8-9
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    <br/>
    neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.

<br>
    For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
    <br/>
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    <br/>
    and my thoughts than your thoughts.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This verse is clearly telling us that God’s ways are higher than our own.
    Those who wish to promote the traditional doctrine of hell close the book
    at this point and say: “See, you just have to accept it (hell) because
    God’s ways are higher than yours! Case closed!”
</p>
<p>
    But this is not what the verse is saying <em>at all.</em> Recall once again
    that Satan likes to take verses out of context and that he tried to tempt
    Jesus himself with this tactic. Now consider the immediate context of
    Isaiah 55:8-9. Here is the whole chapter:
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 55
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Come, everyone who thirsts,
    <br/>
    come to the waters;
    <br/>
    and he who has no money,
    <br/>
    come, buy and eat!
    <br/>
    Come, buy wine and milk
    <br/>
    without money and without price.
    <br/>
    Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
    <br/>
    and your labor for that which does not satisfy?
    <br/>
    Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good,
    <br/>
    and delight yourselves in rich food.
    <br/>
    Incline your ear, and come to me;
    <br/>
    hear, that your soul may live;
    <br/>
    and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
    <br/>
    my steadfast, sure love for David.
    <br/>
    Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples,
    <br/>
    a leader and commander for the peoples.
    <br/>
    Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,
    <br/>
    and a nation that did not know you shall run to you,
    <br/>
    because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel,
    <br/>
    for he has glorified you.
<br>
<br>
    “Seek the Lord while he may be found;
    <br/>
    call upon him while he is near;
    <br/>
    let the wicked forsake his way,
    <br/>
    and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
    <br/>
    let him return to the Lord, that he may have compassion on him,
    <br/>
    and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
    <br/>
    <strong>For my thoughts are not your thoughts,</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>neither are your ways my ways, declares the </strong>
    <strong>Lord</strong>
    <strong>.</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>so are my ways higher than your ways</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>and my thoughts than your thoughts.</strong>
    <strong></strong>
<br>
<br>
    “For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven
    <br/>
    and do not return there but water the earth,
    <br/>
    making it bring forth and sprout,
    <br/>
    giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
    <br/>
    so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;
    <br/>
    it shall not return to me empty,
    <br/>
    but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
    <br/>
    and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
<br>
<br>
    “For you shall go out in joy
    <br/>
    and be led forth in peace;
    <br/>
    the mountains and the hills before you
    <br/>
    shall break forth into singing,
    <br/>
    and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
    <br/>
    Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress;
    <br/>
    instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;
    <br/>
    and it shall make a name for the Lord,
    <br/>
    an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    What is Isaiah 55 really about? Contemplate this deeply.
</p>
<p>
    Is it about accepting the doctrine of hell?
</p>
<p>
    If you said yes to the above question, you need to get your head examined.
</p>
<p>
    The passage is clearly about God’s goodness and redemption. It is about His
    free gift of salvation that He offers to “everyone who thirsts.” This is
    undeniable. But here’s the really important thing that you must not miss…
    The passage not only tells us that His ways are not our ways and His
    thoughts are not our thoughts, but also tells us <em>how</em> our ways and
    thoughts are different! Look closely:
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 55: 6-9
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Seek the Lord while he may be found;
    <br/>
    call upon him while he is near;
    <br/>
    <strong>let the wicked forsake his way,</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>and the unrighteous man his thoughts;</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        let him return to the Lord
    </strong>
    , that he may have <strong>compassion</strong> on him,
    <br/>
    and to our God, <strong>for he will abundantly pardon</strong>.
    <br/>
    <strong>For</strong>
    my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    <br/>
    neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
    <br/>
    For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
    <br/>
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    <br/>
    and my thoughts than your thoughts.
</blockquote>
<p>
    When the text says “<strong><em>for</em> </strong>my thoughts are not your
    thoughts…” it is referencing the previous verse by saying “for.” It is
explaining that God’s thoughts and ways are higher than ours<em> because</em> God will have <em>compassion</em> and    <em>abundantly pardon</em> the wicked when they turn to Him! It is clearly
    teaching that we aren’t like God because we are not merciful and forgiving
    like He is!
</p>
<p>
    It is clearly <em>not</em> saying that we need to ignore our consciences
    and just accept what we are told to believe.
</p>
<p>
    On the contrary, the Bible encourages us to listen to our consciences.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 1:18-19
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the
    prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the
    battle well, <strong>holding on to faith and a good conscience</strong>,
    which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the
    faith.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 3:9

They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with    <strong>a clear conscience</strong>.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 1:3-7
</h3>
<blockquote>
    As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that
    you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer or
    to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote
    controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by
    faith.

        The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a
        good conscience and a sincere faith

    want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking
    about or what they so confidently affirm.

<p>
    Have you ever considered the possibility that the doctrine of hell feels
    wrong to your conscience <em>because it actually is wrong</em>? Is it
    possible that hell is one of the myths that Paul is referencing that leads
    to controversial speculations, rather than advancing God’s work? Doctrines
    of eternal punishment, after all, were common to many pagan cultures. And
    the philosophical speculations used to defend the doctrine are lacking in
    biblical support and highly irrational, as we have already seen.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps the doctrine of hell violates our consciences because God, through
    His Holy Spirit is “training us to renounce ungodliness” as Titus 2:12
    says. Remember, the context of Isaiah 55 clearly explains that people
    aren’t like God because they don’t want the wicked to be pardoned. This
    attitude is <em>ungodly</em>! People are vindictive and cruel, but God is a
    loving Father who rejoices at the repentance of the lost. May we become
    more like Him!
</p>
<h4>
    Other important aspects of Isaiah 55
</h4>
<p>
    It is somewhat ironic that people try to defend the doctrine of hell by
    invoking Isaiah 55 since it says so much that contradicts the doctrine.
    Consider the continued explanation of the ways in which God’s ways are
    higher than ours:
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 55:8-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    <br/>
    neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
    <br/>
    For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
    <br/>
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    <br/>
    and my thoughts than your thoughts.
<br>
<br>
    For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven
    <br/>
    and do not return there but water the earth,
    <br/>
    making it bring forth and sprout,
    <br/>
    giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
    <br/>
    so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;
    <br/>
    it shall not return to me empty,
    <br/>
    but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
    <br/>
    and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it.
</blockquote>
<p>
    I have already discussed the significance of this part of the passage in an
    earlier chapter, but it bears repeating since we all tend to forget the
    great truths of God’s word. Notice that the God’s ways are higher than ours
    because His word accomplishes what He purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Remember that Jesus is God’s Word and that “God did not send his Son into
the world to condemn the world, but <strong>to</strong>    <strong> save the world through him</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
Remember that the Lord is “not willing that any should perish, but that    <strong>all should come to repentance</strong>” (2 Peter 3:9).
</p>
<p>
    Remember that God said: “<strong>By myself I have sworn</strong>; from my
    mouth has gone out in righteousness a word that shall not return:
    <strong>
        ‘To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear allegiance’
    </strong>
    (Isaiah 45:23).
</p>
<p>
    God has a purpose. He has told us what it is and sworn by Himself that He
    will accomplish it. Fortunately for us, His ways are higher than our ways
    so He will accomplish what he has sworn.
</p>
<p>
    How will He accomplish this task? How can He cleanse and redeem even the
    worst of humanity? It is hard for many of us to believe that He will
    forgive the evils of history, and bring even the worst of dictators to
    their knees in humble adoration. But we are told that through His judgment
    and through His grace, everyone will bow. We could never accomplish the
    task that He has purposed but He can because He is the “mighty one who will
    save<strong>”</strong> (Zephaniah 3:17). We can’t even conceive of how such
    a task could be done! But that is <em>how</em> His ways are higher than
ours! He is not like us, because    <em>He is so much better than we can even imagine</em>!
</p>
<p>
    Isaiah 55 is a chapter devoted entirely to a beautiful story of God’s
    redemption. Claiming it for the doctrine of hell and using it to force
    people to accept said doctrine against their God-given consciences is
    unjustifiable.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Still</em>
    some people will argue that God can do what He wants, therefore hell is
    acceptable. And they will say that we have no right to question Him, using
    verses like the following as “support.”
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 135:6
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The Lord does whatever pleases him,
<br>

    in the heavens and on the earth,
<br>

    in the seas and all their depths.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Psalm 115:3</h3>
<blockquote>
    Our God is in heaven;
he does whatever pleases him.</blockquote>
<p>
    I must admit that I feel as if I shouldn’t really need to address these
    much (considering what we have just read about God’s purpose and desire),
    but I will. I fully agree with both of these verses, but think that they
    should be turned on those who claim eternal hell. God has told you what He
    pleases (i.e. that all should come to repentance). God has told you his
    purpose to save the world, even if some must pass through fire that
    destroys the flesh. He has <em>sworn by Himself</em> that every knee will
    bow to Him and every tongue will swear allegiance to Him.
</p>
<p>
Who are you to talk back to Him and say that He <em>must</em> punish people    <em>eternally</em> to fit your theology? Who are you to box Him in with
    your philosophical constructs or tell Him that He won’t accomplish His
    will?
</p>
<p>
    He does whatever He pleases. He has told us what He pleases.
</p>
<p>
    And He will do it.
