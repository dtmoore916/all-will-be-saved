<h1>
    What About Death?
</h1>
<p>
    In the previous chapter on the biblical use of the word “destruction,”
    death was also briefly discussed. Jesus stated that the prodigal son, for
    example, “was dead, and is alive.” This statement shows death being used as
    figurative language to describe a state of sinfulness that prevents us from
the knowledge of God. It also clearly shows the state of being dead to be    <em>impermanent</em>. This is important to recognize because those who wish
    to promote the idea of eternal conscious torment will claim that death
    refers to a never-ending state of condemnation in hell. As an example, I
    recently heard Romans 6:23 being used as purported evidence for eternal
    hell. It says, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
    eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” The interpretation being given was
    that “death” in this passage meant “eternal hell.” There is, however, no
    evidence from the immediate context of the passage, nor from other parts of
    the Bible that such an equivalence is valid. On the contrary, there is
    abundant evidence against such a claim.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s begin by looking at the immediate context of the verse:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 6
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
    By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any
    longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ
    Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him
    through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from
    the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly
    also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our
    old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done
    away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— because anyone who
    has died has been set free from sin.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For
    we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again;
    death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin
    once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ
    Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey
    its evil desires. Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument
    of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been
    brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an
    instrument of righteousness. For sin shall no longer be your master,
    because you are not under the law, but under grace.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace?
    By no means! Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as
    obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves
    to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to
    righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to
    sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has
    now claimed your allegiance. You have been set free from sin and have
    become slaves to righteousness.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations.
    Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to
    ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to
    righteousness leading to holiness. When you were slaves to sin, you were
    free from the control of righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that
    time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
    But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God,
    the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. For
    the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ
    Jesus our Lord.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Romans 6 discusses death quite a bit. It is quite telling, therefore, that
    there is no mention of eternal conscious torment whatsoever. Interpreting
    death to mean eternal hell demonstrates an undeniable decontextualization
    of the word from the passage. It cannot reasonably be interpreted this way
    in context and there is no evidence that it should be. Instead, death is
    used in 2 primary ways. It is discussed in a positive sense as well as a
    negative sense, but neither of these refers to eternal hell.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is used in a positive sense to describe the state of believers
    who have died to sin and are therefore no longer slaves to it. This is what
    is meant by the baptism of Christians into Christ’s death so that we can
    live a new life, free from bondage to sin.
</p>
<p>
    Second, it is used in a negative sense to describe the result of a sinful
    lifestyle as contrasted with the eternal holy life offered to us in Christ.
    As a reminder, Jesus defined eternal life for us, not in terms of its
    unending duration, but rather qualitatively as knowing Him and the Father
    God (John 17:3). Therefore, as a proper contrast, death would be the state
    of <em>not knowing Him or the Father</em>. This is a state that we all
    experience prior to coming to know Him and is therefore clearly temporary,
    not eternal. This is why the passage says to “offer yourselves to God as
those who have been brought <em>from death to life.” </em>Notice that    <em>death was the past tense state </em>of believers prior to coming to
know Christ, but that they have been brought <em>from</em>    <em>death to life.</em> It is impossible to say that death refers to
    eternal hell in this context because we certainly were not in eternal hell
    prior to knowing Christ. Instead, we were figuratively dead in our sins due
    to our slavery to them.
</p>
<p>
    This is why we must die to our sinful natures. This is the positive sense
    of death, in which “our old self was crucified with him so that the body
    ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to
    sin—because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.” Notice that
    death to sin through Christ is the key to freedom from slavery to sin.
</p>
<p>
    So we are free from sin which leads to death in the negative sense (a lack
    of knowledge of God) because we die to our sins in Christ. This death to
    sin is necessary and is the method through which we are saved from death
    (the negative effects of sin). This is Paul’s argument in the passage. This
    may seem confusing since Paul is using death in two different ways, but it
    is a definite biblical theme, and echoes Jesus’ statement in Matthew
    17:24-25:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their
    cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but
    whoever loses their life for me will find it.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Crucifixion in the Roman Empire meant death. By taking up our cross and
    dying to our self-centered, sinful ways, we find true life (knowing God).
    If instead we seek to continue in a life of selfish rebellion, we find
    death because we are in a state that prevents us from knowing and
    understanding God. But death is not permanent because repentance is
    available. For this reason, we can move from death to life.
</p>
<p>
    The understanding that death is a figurative, temporary state representing
    sinfulness is endemic to Paul’s writings.
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 2:1-5
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And <strong>you were dead in your trespasses and sins</strong> in which you    <strong>previously</strong> lived according to the ways of this world,
    according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit now working in
the disobedient. We too    <strong>all previously lived among them in our fleshly desires</strong>,
    carrying out the inclinations of our flesh and thoughts, and we were by
    nature children under wrath as the others were also. But God, who is rich
    in mercy, because of his great love that he had for us,
    <strong>
        made us alive with Christ even though we were dead in trespasses.
    </strong>
    You are saved by grace!
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice once again that Paul, speaking to believers in Ephesus, says that
    they <em>were dead</em> in their trespasses and sins. Death is a past state
    for believers, all of whom previously were dead and served our “fleshly
    desires.” But we are no longer dead because God “made us alive with Christ
    even though we were dead in trespasses” because of His rich mercy and great
    love.
</p>
<p>
    There are many other examples of this usage of “death” language throughout
    the New Testament. Here are just a few:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 7:9-11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin
    came alive and I died. The very commandment that promised life proved to be
    death to me. For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
    deceived me and through it killed me.
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Romans 7:24-25
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks
    be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    2 Corinthians 4:11
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For we who live are always being given over to <strong>death</strong> for
    Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal
    flesh.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    And many more…
</p>
<p>
    So, in the Bible death does not refer to a permanent state of torment for
    the lost, but rather to a state of sinfulness that inhibits our knowledge
    of God. It also refers to the method by which we escape the bondage of sin
    that leads to this death. By dying to sin and living for God, we can be
free to serve Him and enjoy His plan for us. This is true life, the    <em>aionios</em> life that the gospel speaks of. The wages of sin,
    therefore, is missing out on this true life. But thank God, though we all
    have experienced the wages of sin in our lives, Christ came to set everyone
    free from our slavery to sin so that we can live in Him! He truly is “the
    Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29) and for that,
    we can rejoice!
