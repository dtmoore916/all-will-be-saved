<h1>
    Addressing Objections: What About Shame?
</h1>
<p>
    In the previous chapter, Isaiah 45:23 was briefly mentioned. This is the
    Old Testament verse that says: “To me [God] every knee shall bow, every
    tongue shall swear allegiance.” The reason I bring this verse up again is
    because some people have argued that the bowing and swearing are forced,
    citing the fact that those who were angry with God will be “ashamed”
    (Isaiah 45:24). From this, it is argued that those who are ashamed are
    hell-bound and reluctantly bowing with rebellion still burning in their
    hearts. Let’s now examine why this interpretation is deeply flawed.
</p>
<p>
    Now, we’ve already discussed in an earlier chapter that the New Testament
    passages that reference Isaiah 45:23, use language that indicate true
    worship of God when people bow their knees and confess with their mouths.
    Here are the New Testament passages for reference:
</p>
<h3>
    Philippians 2:9-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name
which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus    <strong>every knee will bow</strong>,
    <strong>
        of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that
    </strong>
    <strong>every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</strong>
    , to the glory of God the Father.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14%3A11&amp;version=ESV"
        >
            Romans 14:11
        </a>
        (ESV)
   
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For it is written, “As I live, says the Lord,
    <strong>
        every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
    </strong>
    ”
</blockquote>
<p>
    In these passages, the word for bow is <em>kampsei (</em>κάμψει), which
    refers to bowing in worship and veneration (
    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/2578.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/greek/2578.htm
    </a>
    ), and the word for confess is
    <em>
        <a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/exomologe_setai_1843.htm"
            title="exomologēsetai: shall confess"
        >
            exomologēsetai
        </a>
    </em>
    <em>(</em>
    ἐξομολογήσεται) which refers to wholehearted free agreement from the heart,
    and also connotes giving thanks and praise (
    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/1843.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/greek/1843.htm
    </a>
    ). In Isaiah, the Hebrew words used do not have clear connotations, but
    rather could be used in a positive or negative sense. Given the fact that
    the New Testament writer (Paul) clarifies the connotations of the words, it
    is most reasonable to agree with his interpretation if we take the whole
    counsel of Scripture. The context of the passage is further confirmation
    that the apostle Paul’s interpretation in Romans and Philippians is
    correct. Let’s take a look:
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 45:21-25
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Declare and present your case;
    <br/>
    let them take counsel together!
    <br/>
    Who told this long ago?
    <br/>
    Who declared it of old?
    <br/>
    Was it not I, the Lord?
    <br/>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>And there is no other god besides me,</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        a righteous God and a Savior
    </strong>
    ;
    <br/>
    there is none besides me.
<br>
<br>
    “<strong>Turn to me and be saved,</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>all the ends of the earth!</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>For I am God, and there is no other.</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        By myself I have sworn;
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>from my mouth has gone out in righteousness</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>a word that shall not return:</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        ‘To me every knee shall bow,
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>every tongue shall swear allegiance.’</strong>
    <strong></strong>
<br>
<br>
    <strong>“Only in the </strong>
    <strong>Lord</strong>
    <strong>, it shall be said of me,</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>are righteousness and strength;</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
    </strong>
    to him shall come and be ashamed
    <br/>
    all who were incensed against him.
    <br/>
    In the Lord all the offspring of Israel
    <br/>
    shall be justified and shall glory.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is clear from the passage that the people who are bowing and swearing
    allegiance are not being false. It is also clear that God swears by Himself
    that <em>everyone</em> will acknowledge Him and swear allegiance, saying
    that only in Him “are righteousness and strength.” This is emphasized in
    Philippians when Paul states that those who bow will be all “those who are
in heaven and on earth and under the earth.” Clearly, everyone knee means    <em>every knee</em>. Bowing will be universal. By the way, swearing
    allegiance means that you are solemnly promising loyalty. It is impossible
    to interpret it in a different way and be honest. So, the context of the
    passage is clearly talking about the ends of the earth finding salvation in
    God and turning to Him.
</p>
<p>
    But those who wish to promote the doctrine of hell will say that we must
    ignore all of this contextual evidence and focus on the fact that “all who
    were incensed against him” will “come and be ashamed.” See, they will tell
    you, they are ashamed and that means that they are going to hell!
</p>
<p>
    But let’s think reasonably about this. Does being ashamed mean the same
    thing as going to hell? Can we write the following equation: ashamed =
    eternal fiery damnation? Clearly not.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, we have all been ashamed and I would argue that this is one of the
    prerequisites for coming to God. We repent and turn to Him <em>because</em>
    we recognize our sins, and come face to face with our unrighteousness. Why
    else would we repent and acknowledge that only in the LORD are
    “righteousness and strength?” Let’s look at some Biblical examples now of
    shame leading to repentance.
</p>
<p>
    In Acts 2, Peter is preaching to the crowds on the day of Pentecost. Let’s
    see what he says and how the crowd responds:
</p>
<h3>
    Acts 2:36-41
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made
    him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
<br>
<br>
    Now when they heard this they <strong>were cut to the heart</strong>, and
    said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
    And Peter said to them, “
    <strong>
        Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
        the forgiveness of your sins
    </strong>
    , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for
    you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the
    Lord our God calls to himself.” And with many other words he bore witness
    and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked
    generation.” So those who received his word were baptized, and there were
    added that day about three thousand souls.
</blockquote>
<p>
    After Peter tells his hearers that the mercilessly crucified their Messiah,
    they are “cut to the heart.” In other words, they felt deeply ashamed. This
    should not be surprising. They are being told that they cried out and
    persuaded the Roman government to murder their Savior, the promised one. Of
    course they were ashamed!
</p>
<p>
    But notice the result of this shame. They ask Peter what they should do and
    he responds that they should repent and be baptized. And three thousand of
    them respond to this call to repentance. Why do they respond and repent? It
    is apparent that the reason for this repentance was acknowledgment of
    wrongdoing. Shame drives repentance and the desire to come to God for
    forgiveness.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that even believers are ashamed of our mistakes is confirmed in
    Romans:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 6:20-21
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
    But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you
    are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that believers are <em>ashamed</em> of their former sinful conduct.
Won’t those who bow the knee and swear allegiance to God also be ashamed of    <em>their </em>former sinful ways? Does this preclude them from salvation?
    Of course not. Indeed, the reason why they are ashamed is because they have
    had a change of heart. Otherwise they wouldn’t feel shame, but would rather
    boast in their sinfulness. So being ashamed of their anger toward God is
    not evidence of being hell-bound, but rather evidence of a repentant heart!
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Christian, consider your former life, prior to Christ. Are you
    proud of your sins? Think back on the reason why you chose Christ. Was it
    because you felt self-righteous and self sufficient, or was it because you
    were ashamed of the evil in your heart? It is clear that we turn to God
    because we acknowledge our unrighteousness and our need for Him.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, shame is the stimulus that results in the response of
    repentance. It is evidence of a changed heart that wants to please the God
    to whom we will all bow and swear allegiance, “a righteous God and a
    Savior,” the One who says: “Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the
    earth!”
