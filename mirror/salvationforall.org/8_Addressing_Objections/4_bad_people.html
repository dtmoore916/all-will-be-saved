<h1>
    Addressing Objections: The “Bad People Don’t Get In” Argument
</h1>
<p>
    This is a common argument against the biblical teaching of salvation for
    all men. It is based on certain biblical passages that discuss the fact
    that the wicked will be judged and that God’s wrath is upon them. One of
    the most famous and well known of these passages is found in the book of
    Romans, written by the apostle Paul. Let’s examine it now, but as we do,
    keep in mind that Paul was a very intelligent, educated man, well-versed in
    rhetoric and argumentation. Also, I am going to emphasize Paul’s use of the
    words “they,” “their” and “them” in the passage by showing them in bold.
    You will see why in a bit (wait for it…).
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 1:18-32
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness
    and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by <strong>their</strong>
wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to <strong>them</strong>, because God has made it plain to    <strong>them</strong>. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible
    qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being
    understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
<br>
<br>
    For although <strong>they</strong> knew God, <strong>they</strong> neither
    glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but <strong>their</strong>
    thinking became futile and <strong>their</strong> foolish hearts were
darkened. Although <strong>they</strong> claimed to be wise,    <strong>they</strong> became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal
    God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals
    and reptiles.
<br>
<br>
Therefore God gave <strong>them</strong> over in the sinful desires of<strong> their</strong> hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of    <strong>their</strong> bodies with one another. <strong>They</strong>
    exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created
    things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
<br>
<br>
    Because of this, God gave <strong>them</strong> over to shameful lusts.
    Even <strong>their</strong> women exchanged natural sexual relations for
    unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations
    with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed
    shameful acts with other men, and received in <strong>themselves</strong>
    the due penalty for <strong>their</strong> error.
<br>
<br>
    Furthermore, just as <strong>they</strong> did not think it worthwhile to
    retain the knowledge of God, so God gave <strong>them</strong> over to a
depraved mind, so that <strong>they</strong> do what ought not to be done.    <strong>They</strong> have become filled with every kind of wickedness,
    evil, greed and depravity. <strong>They</strong> are full of envy, murder,
    strife, deceit and malice. <strong>They</strong> are gossips, slanderers,
    God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; <strong>they</strong> invent
    ways of doing evil; <strong>they</strong> disobey <strong>their</strong>
    parents; <strong>they</strong> have no understanding, no fidelity, no love,
    no mercy. Although <strong>they</strong> know God’s righteous decree that
    those who do such things deserve death, <strong>they</strong> not only
continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice    <strong>them</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice how Paul calls <em>them</em> out and discusses all of the evil that    <em>they </em>do. You might at this point be feeling glad that you aren’t
    one of <em>them</em>, maybe even a little smug and superior. If that’s you,
    you are Paul’s target audience and you’d better buckle up because the <em>very
    next verses</em> are the crux of the argument, and the twist might hurt a bit.
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 2:1-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong>You</strong>
    , therefore, have no excuse, <strong>you</strong> who pass judgment on
someone else, for at whatever point <strong>you</strong> judge another,<strong> you</strong> are condemning <strong>yourself</strong>, because    <strong>you</strong> who pass judgment do the same things. Now we know that
God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. So when    <strong>you</strong>, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do
    the same things, do <strong>you</strong> think <strong>you</strong> will
    escape God’s judgment? Or do <strong>you</strong> show contempt for the
    riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s
    kindness is intended to lead <strong>you</strong> to repentance?
<br>
<br>
    But because of <strong>your</strong> stubbornness and <strong>your</strong>
unrepentant heart, <strong>you</strong> are storing up wrath against    <strong>yourself</strong> for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous
    judgment will be revealed. God “will repay each person according to what
    they have done.” To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory,
    honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are
    self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath
    and anger. There will be trouble and distress for every human being who
    does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honor and
    peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
    For God does not show favoritism.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Why did Paul suddenly change his pronoun usage from “they” to “you?” Did he
    just abruptly change topics?&nbsp; Is Paul a bit senile and forgot who and 
	what he was talking about?
</p>
<p>
    No!&nbsp; His argument is continuing and he has intentionally turned the tables
    on his audience. To those who were judgmentally looking down on others he
    says “No, I’ve been talking to <em>you! </em>This is about <em>you</em>,
    not them! <em>You</em> do the same things! Stop being hypocrites!” In fact,
    he argues that our judgmental attitudes toward others actually store up
    God’s wrath <em>against</em> <em>us. </em>
</p>
<p>
    You see, Paul is putting us all in the same boat. We are all sinners in
    need of a Savior.&nbsp; <em>All of us!</em> Being a rebellious sinner doesn’t
    preclude you from God’s grace; it is the very reason you need it, the very
    reason we all need it.
</p>
<p>
    So this passage isn’t arguing that sinners cannot enter the kingdom of God
    but rather that we are all sinners and can only enter by his grace.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the text does not discuss eternal punishment or hell at all.
    This may surprise you if you consider “wrath” and “hell” to be synonymous.
    They clearly are not. In fact, Paul tells us specifically what he is
    referring to when he discusses God’s wrath in this passage. Go back and
    read Romans 1:18-32 to see what it is.
</p>
<p>
    Do you see it?
</p>
<p>
    He “gave them over” to their “sinful desires,” to “shameful lusts” and to
    “a depraved mind.” And as a result they “received in themselves the due
    penalty for their error.” This is God’s wrath on them, being allowed to
    have foolish hearts and participate in destructive behaviors.&nbsp; Don’t we see
    how the destructive choices we make ruin us?&nbsp; This is the wrath of God being
    discussed in the passage and it is temporary, not eternal.
</p>
	<p>
    This interpretation echoes Jesus' statements in John 3:18-19:</p>
	<blockquote>
		Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe 
		<strong>is condemned already</strong>, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.&nbsp; And 
		<strong>this is the judgment</strong>: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that those who do not believe are condemned <em>already</em>.&nbsp; 
	Jesus, like Paul, is clearly referrring to the present state of those who do 
	not yet believe in Him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpreting His words as referring to a 
	future condemnation is a misread of the text.&nbsp; He tells us specifically 
	what they are condemned to, and it isn't eternal hell, but rather loving the 
	darkness.&nbsp; For this reason, those who do not follow Christ miss out on 
	his light and are given over to the darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, as Jesus 
	says, <em>is the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>
</p>
	<p>
    But there is no reason to believe that this judgment is eternal.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Rather there is every reason to be certain that it is not.&nbsp; The reason 
	I say this is that it is abundantly clear that <em>everybody must come to 
	belief</em> in Christ in order to <em>become believers</em>.&nbsp; Everyone 
	<em>starts out as an 
	unbeliever</em>.&nbsp; Does this mean that they are <em>forever condemned</em> to 
	live in darkness?&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp;&nbsp; We were all 
	condemned to loving darkness before we came to understand the light of 
	Christ, for "while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).&nbsp; 
	Now those of us who believe have come to realize God's great love for us and 
	have begun the sanctification process.&nbsp; As 1 John 4:16 says: "So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Notice here the difference between those who believe and those who don't is 
	that believers know and believe the love God has for us.&nbsp; The love of 
	God for us was already a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Believers just have the 
	privilege of understanding this reality and living into it as we continually 
	grow in our walk with Christ.&nbsp; </p>
	<h4>Does Romans 2 Also Refer to a Future Wrath?</h4>
	<p>Although part of the wrath of God described in Romans 1-2 is the 
	consequences that we experience when we are turned over to our sinful ways, 
	there is also acknowledgment of future wrath and judgment on "the day of 
	God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed."&nbsp; Notice 
	that at this future judgment, God repays "each person according to what they 
	have done" and that those who do evil experience "trouble and distress."&nbsp; 
	Notice also that Paul is sternly warning <em>believers</em> in this passage 
	to <em>stop being judgmental</em> or they will be storing up wrath for 
	themselves.&nbsp; This judgmentalism is the evil that Paul is specifically 
	referring to in the passage, saying that it shows "contempt for the
    riches of his [God's] kindness, forbearance and patience," which are meant 
	to lead us to humble repentance, not arrogant judgmentalism.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>So God will also judge evil at a future judgment, referred to in this 
	passage as the "day of God's wrath."&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not something I am 
	disputing.&nbsp; But it is clear from this passage that believers who insist 
	on judging others will experience this wrath, since they are violating 
	Jesus' clear command to "not judge, or you too will be judged" (Matthew 
	7:1).&nbsp; In Matthew 7, Jesus follows up this command with reasoning that 
	matches Paul's warning to the Roman believers.</p>
	<h3>Matthew 7:1-3</h3>
	<blockquote>
		"Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
		<br><br>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"</blockquote>
	<p>
    Does this mean that believers who are judgmental toward other people will be 
	condemned to eternal hell, since they are "storing up wrath" against 
	themselves?&nbsp; I do not believe that it does (and if it does, the number 
	of believers in hell will go up astronomically).&nbsp; Instead, it is simply 
	another sin that God will have to purify us of before we are able to enter 
	into the fullness of His kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will God's wrath and anger at 
	judgmental attitudes and other evils cause people "trouble and distress"?&nbsp; 
	I think that it clearly will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this mean that the trouble 
	and distress people experience will never end?&nbsp; No, it does not, "for 
	his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime" (Psalm 30:5).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<h4>Another Passage About "Bad" People</h4>
	<p>
    Now, let’s look at one more passage that could be used to argue
    (disingenuously) against God’s ultimate salvation of mankind.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Corinthians 6:7-11 (NIV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been
    completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be
    cheated? Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to
    your brothers and sisters. Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not
    inherit the kingdom of God?&nbsp; Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually
    immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor
    thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will
    inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were
    washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord
    Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This is another classic passage used to claim that sinners will go to hell.
    But, once again, this misses the point of the passage. Notice the context.
    Paul is reprimanding <em>believers</em> for suing one another in court. As we have
    seen earlier, salvation is from our sins. Yet, Paul says, these believers
    are sinning against one another by these lawsuits and not acting like the
    kingdom of God on earth, as they were called to do.&nbsp; Those who insist 
	on persistently practicing wickedness do not inherit the benefits of the 
	kingdom of God in the present, nor in the future if they continue to persist 
	in their evil ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why he warns
    that wrongdoers won’t inherit the kingdom of God and lists some
    wrongdoings.
</p>
<p>
    But once again, we see God’s redemptive purpose. Right after listing the
    types of sinners that won’t inherit the kingdom, he says “and that is what
    some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were
    justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our
    God.”
</p>
<p>
    Yet again, we see God redeeming people through Christ, regardless of their
    former rebellion. And we see in other passages that this washing, sanctification, and
    justification are universally applied, “for as in Adam all die, so also in
    Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22) because Christ’s “one
    act of righteousness leads to
    <strong>
        justification and life for all men” 
    </strong>
	(<a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A18&amp;version=ESV"
        >Romans 5:18</a>)<strong>.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We all will eventually experience cleansing and restoration, by the power
    of God through Christ because that is what God said He will do!
