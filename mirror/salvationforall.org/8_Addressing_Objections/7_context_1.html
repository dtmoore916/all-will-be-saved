<h1>
    Addressing Objections: The Context Question
</h1>
<p>
    One criticism of the concept of salvation for all people is that the Bible
    verses being used to support the concept are taken out of context. It is
    important to carefully examine whether this claim is true or not as it
    significantly impacts the claims that have been made thus far.
</p>
<p>
    I agree that context is extremely important to interpretation, so it was
    one of the first things that I began investigating in my research of this
    topic. I have found that the context of the passages that teach that all
    people will be saved further support the concept, rather than the reverse,
    as is claimed by opponents. But now, let’s look at this criticism from
    those who hold to the doctrine of eternal punishment to see their argument.
</p>
<p>
    I was told by a pastor friend that the best book (in his opinion) defending
    the traditional doctrine of hell is <em>Hell Under Fire</em>, so we will
    look at the arguments of J.I. Packer against universalism (as set forth in
    this book) next.
</p>
<div class="box">
    By the way, the concept that all will be saved is sometimes
    called universalism, but I have not been using this term since it also has
    been used by groups of people who use it in a completely different sense
    from the argument I’m making. These groups may use the term to denote a
    syncretism in which all religions are the same and sin is inconsequential,
    which is clearly different from the biblical view that God will save all
    people that I have been advocating.
</div>
<h3>
    J.I. Packer
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “In most versions of universalist theory, it is common ground that biblical
    teaching is from God and is to be taken as true and trustworthy;
    interpretation and application are singled out as the areas of dispute. Now
    the proper key principles here are, and always will be, that interpretation
    must be context-specific, author-specific, and focus-specific. That means,
    first, that passages must be exegeted in terms of the thought-flow of which
    they are part and not have their meaning extrapolated beyond the manifest
    perspectives, limits, and boundaries of that thought-flow; otherwise, we
    will be reading into them what cannot truly be read out of them. (2) It
    also means that writers must not be assumed to contradict themselves, but
    must be respected as knowing their own minds; thus, what they write in one
    place must be treated as cohering with what they write elsewhere. And it
    means, finally, that in seeking the writer’s meaning, we must never lose
    sight of the immediate point he is making, the persuasive strategy of which
    that point is part, and the effect that he shows himself wanting to produce
on his readers.” (Packer J. I. "    <em>Chapter 8: Universalism: Will Everyone Ultimately Be Saved?</em>")
</blockquote>
<p>
    J.I. Packer makes some good points about the necessity of understanding
    context and the author’s intent in writing a passage. He also makes a good
    point that biblical authors do not contradict themselves.
</p>
<p>
But then he does a curious thing. He continues to write and merely    <em>insinuates</em> that those who believe that God will save all people
    are violating these principles, without giving any compelling evidence or
    examples of them doing so. Now, if you are going to argue that someone is
    taking Bible verses out of context, shouldn’t you explain why you think
    this to be the case? Yet, somehow, he doesn’t find this necessary. Instead
    of addressing the supposed contextual issues in the “universalist”
    argument, he lists a series of verses that supposedly teach about eternal
    hell (which we’ve already debunked).
</p>
<p>
    Now we’re going to examine the really disturbing part of Mr. Packer’s
    argument. Remember that he insinuates that those who believe in salvation
    for everyone are taking verses out of context. With that in mind, carefully
    examine the following excerpt.
</p>
<h3>
    J.I. Packer
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Every aspect of salvation is the fruit of God’s free, sovereign, holy,
    Christ-exalting love.
<br>
<br>
    Twice John declares that God is <em>agap’</em> (1 John 4:8, 16). The logic
    of the phrase is parallel to that of “God is light” (1 John 1:5) and “our
    God is a consuming fire” (Heb. 12:29; cf. 12:18; also 6:8; 10:27). “Is” in
    each of these texts points to the consistent expression of a particular
    characteristic in God’s behavior toward human beings. Here the
    characteristic is love, <em>agap’.</em> John does not mean that God’s
    character consists of, and his activity expresses, only <em>agap’ </em>to
    the exclusion of all else,
    <strong>
        but that all his acts in relation to those who become, and are,
        Christians (“us,” 1 John 4:9-10) are acts of <em>agap’</em></strong>, one way or another, whatever other aspects of his character they show
    forth as well.
<br>
<br>
    John continues by saying that
    <strong>
        God’s supreme demonstration of this <em>agap’</em> was sending his Son
        to be the propitiatory (wrath-quenching) sacrifice for our sins (cf.
        2:2)
    </strong>
    , and to become the sustaining source of our new life as God’s
    supernaturally born children. The particularizing nuance in all this is
    well caught in some words from James Montgomery’s hymn, “Hail to the Lord’s
    Anointed”:
<br>
<br>
    The tide of time shall never
<br>
    His covenant remove;
<br>

    His Name shall stand forever—
<br>

    That Name <strong><em>to us</em></strong><sup> </sup> is Love.
<br>
<br>
    It is what God is <strong>to Christians specifically</strong> that John is
    highlighting here.

<br>
   
(Packer J. I. "        <em>Chapter 8: Universalism: Will Everyone Ultimately Be Saved?</em>")
 </blockquote>   

<p>
    The parts of the passage that I have shown in bold is what we will focus on
    primarily to see how Dr. Packer himself takes verses out of context. Notice
    that he is saying that the verses in 1 John (1 John 4:9-10 and 1 John 2:2
    which he references as <em>cf.2.</em>2) only apply to Christians. Do you
    see this? Make sure you do, because it is important that you understand the
    claim that is being made.
</p>
<p>
    As a matter of first importance, notice that Dr. Packer paraphrases 1 John
    2:2, saying that God sent “
    <strong>
        his Son to be the propitiatory (wrath-quenching) sacrifice for our sins
        (cf. 2:2).”
    </strong>
    Remember again, he is using this passage as part of his argument that John
    is referring to “Christians specifically.”
</p>
<p>
    Now let’s look at what 1 John 2:2 actually says.
</p>
<h3>
    <u>
        <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A2&amp;version=ESV"
        >
            1 John 2:2
        </a>
    </u>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and
    <strong>
        not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
    </strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
            Notice (and by the way, this should absolutely floor you), that Dr.
        Packer paraphrases 1 John 2:2 but cuts off the last half of the verse
        that clearly says that Jesus is the atoning sacrifice for the whole
        world, NOT only for us who are Christians. How on earth does he justify
        claiming that the love being discussed in 1 John only applies to
        “Christians specifically”?&nbsp; For someone who is attacking others for
        taking verses out of context, this move seems quite hypocritical. 1
John 2:2 is only <em>one sentence</em> and he does not even finish this        <em>one sentence</em> in his argument to give the proper context of the
        verse! Why not? My only guess is that it would be inconvenient to his
        argument to include the rest of the verse, since it says exactly the
        opposite of what he is arguing!
    
</p>
<p>
    
        So now that we’ve seen the way in which a prominent defender of the
        hell doctrine applies “context,” let’s examine the actual context of 1
        John to see if we are justified in interpreting 1 John 2:2 as evidence
        that Christ is the atoning sacrifice “for the sins of the whole world.”
    
</p>
<p>
    
        I would recommend to you that you read all of 1 John to have a full
        understanding of the context. You should do that now. Go on, read it.
        Read it for yourself, using your own God-given brain, without any
        biased commentaries to aid (or hinder) your understanding. Are you
        done? If so, let’s continue.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        One thing that jumps out to me as centrally thematic to 1 John is love.
        He talks about it specifically in nearly every chapter, encouraging us
        to love God, love others, abide in God’s love, and so on. He also
        encourages us to avoid sin, especially referencing a lack of love as a
        primary sin to be avoided.
    
</p>
<p>
    
        John is writing to believers, and in this context he says “My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if
    anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the
    Righteous One.
    <strong>
        He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but
        also for the sins of the whole world.</strong>” (1 John 1:1-2). It is abundantly clear from the verse that Jesus is the
    atoning sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. This is a clear,
    straightforward reading of the text for what it actually says.
</p>
<p>
    Now someone who feels that they must defend the doctrine of eternal
    punishment has to do some bizarre intellectual backflips (as we’ve already
    seen) to re-interpret this clear passage. Why? The reason is simple: if you
    start out with the premise that the doctrine of hell is true, you have to
    attempt to reason away the clear meaning of this passage. There are several
    ways in which this can be attempted, but they are all intellectually
    dishonest.
</p>
<p>
    First, one might attempt to argue that the phrase “the whole world” doesn’t
    mean what it says. But this argument is nonsense. In the Greek, the word
    for whole is <em>olou</em> (ὅλου) which means whole or complete, according
the the    <a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/1_john/2-2.htm">NASB lexicon</a>.
    We’ve also already seen that the word translated world is <em>kosmou</em>
    (κόσμου), which refers to the world, the world’s inhabitants, or even the
    universe. The fact that John felt it necessary to somewhat redundantly tell
    us that he is referring to the “whole world” suggests that he may have had
    an inkling that people would inappropriately attempt to minimize the
message of salvation. No, he tells us, I really am talking about the    <em>entire world and everyone in it</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Second, one might attempt to argue that Christ’s atoning sacrifice doesn’t
    count unless we are believers. Besides obviously contradicting what 1 John
    2:2 says, this line of reasoning also minimizes Christ’s work on the cross
    and makes Christ’s atoning sacrifice a work that <em>we</em> accomplish.
    But we know that the work of atonement for sin belongs to Christ alone, and
    is not dependent on our works. Consider Ephesians 2:1-9:
</p>
<blockquote>
    As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you
    used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of
    the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are
    disobedient. <strong> </strong>All of us also lived among them at one time,
    gratifying the cravings of our flesh<strong><em><sup> </sup></em></strong>
    and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature
    deserving of wrath
    <strong>
        . But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made
        us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by
        grace you have been saved.
    </strong>
    And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly
    realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the
    incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ
    Jesus.
    <strong>
        For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not
        from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one
        can boast.
    </strong>
    For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which
    God prepared in advance for us to do.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that we are saved by grace through faith in Christ. Now, some will
argue that this means that only those who have faith in Christ    <em>presently</em> will be saved. But if we think reasonably, we can put
    this objection to rest. Remember that Paul was writing to believers in the
    church of Ephesus in the first century, saying that they “have been saved”
    (past tense). Does this mean that those who will come to faith in Christ in
    the future (such as ourselves), won’t be saved by faith? No, the fact that
    Paul is using the past tense and speaking to specific believers does not
    preclude us from applying this verse to ourselves, who came to faith much
    later than Paul’s original audience.
</p>
<p>
Now consider the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that everyone    <em>will</em> come to faith in Christ.
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    <u>Isaiah 45:22-24a</u>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “<strong>Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth</strong>;
    <br/>
    For I am God, and there is no other.
    <br/>
    “I have sworn by Myself,
    <br/>
    The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness
    <br/>
    And will not turn back,
    <br/>
    That to Me
    <strong>
        every knee will bow, every tongue will swear <em>allegiance</em>
    </strong>
    .
    <br/>
    “<strong>They will say of Me, ‘Only in the Lord are righteousness and strength.
    </strong>
    ’
   </blockquote>
<h3>
    Philippians 2:9-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name
which is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus    <strong>every knee will bow</strong>, of those who are in heaven and on
earth and under the earth, and that    <strong>every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</strong>, to
    the glory of God the Father.
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Greek word used in Ephesians for faith is <em>pisteōs </em>(πίστεως),
    which connotes “faith, belief, trust, confidence; fidelity, faithfulness”
according to    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm">Strong’s concordance</a>.
    Isn’t it apparent that God’s word is saying that all people will come to
    faith in Christ when we “swear allegiance,” “confess that Jesus Christ is
    Lord,” bow before him in reverence, and say “only in the Lord are
    righteousness and strength?” These statements all clearly show deep faith
    and trust in God. And, unless we radically reinterpret Scripture to fit our
    preconceived notions about hell, we must admit that these expressions of
    faith will be done by everyone. So, the fact that Ephesians tells us that
    we who already believe have been saved by faith, in no way limits God’s
    ability to save others through faith in the future, even if this has to be
done after death and judgment. In fact, we are told specifically that this    <em>will happen</em> as all people will swear allegiance to God, with Jesus
    Christ acting as the atoning sacrifice that makes this possible.
</p>
<p>
    Now let’s address another interesting example in Dr. Packer’s article that
    claims that God’s love as described in 1 John is applied only “to
    Christians specifically.” He also mentions 1 John 4:9-10 in his argument.
    Let’s look at this section of scripture as well, but take in a bit more of
    the surrounding verses, for context. Remember, once again, that Packer is
    arguing that the love and atoning sacrifice being described is only
    applicable to “us” as Christians.
</p>
<h3>
    1 John 4:7-16
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone
    who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does
    not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among
    us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through
him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that    <strong>he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice</strong> for
    our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one
    another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in
    us and his love is made complete in us.
<br>
    This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of
    his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son
    to be <strong>the Savior of the world</strong>. If anyone acknowledges that
    Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. And so we know
    and rely on the love God has for us.

</blockquote>
<p>
    
        Notice that John is telling us to love one another, using the rationale
        that God showed His love for us by sending “his Son as an atoning
        sacrifice for our sins.” Now, Packer stops here and says that the “us”
        being referred to can only be Christians. But if we actually take the
        verse in context, we see that just a few short verses later, John once
        again makes it clear that Jesus is the “Savior of the world.” He also
        makes it clear that those of us who know God “have seen and testify” to
        the fact that He is indeed the “Savior of the world.”
    
</p>
<p>
    
        It is quite bizarre to argue that “universalists” are taking verses out
        of context using 1 John. This is especially true when you use several
        verses from 1 John out of context yourself, and claim that they mean
        something completely different from what they are saying, as central to
        your argument. The only justification for such tactics is that the
        person using them takes the doctrine of hell as a foundational premise,
        and reasons that Jesus can’t be the atoning sacrifice for the sins of
        the whole world or the Savior of the world because those clear biblical
        truths don’t make sense with the doctrine of hell. There is a reason
        for that, but it isn’t what the hell theorist claims. Rather, the word
        of God is accurate, and the theologian who re-interprets it to
        accommodate the hell doctrine is wrong.
    
</p>
<p>
 
        Keep in mind that 1 John never mentions hell or eternal punishment. Not
        once. Reading it through a hell-tinted filter therefore violates J.I.
        Packer’s own exegetical rules, as quoted earlier in this chapter.
        Reading it for what it clearly says, however, leaves us with an
        understanding of God’s love that leads us to love one another and
        praise Him for His magnificent plan to save the world through Christ.
 
</p>
<p>
 
        So now that you’ve seen the context of 1 John and how it is interpreted
        by someone who believes in the salvation of all people as well as
        someone who believes in eternal hell, I have some questions to ask you:
 
</p>
<p>
    
        Which interpretation is more honest and true to the Scriptures?&nbsp; 
		Which one is more respectful of context and which one manipulates the 
		context?&nbsp;     
</p>
<p>
    In the next chapter, we will examine more of the biblical passages that
    teach the salvation of all people to determine if they are indeed taken out
    of context, or disingenuously maligned. I think that you’ll agree that
    there is no reason to doubt their clearly stated meanings by the time we
    are done.
