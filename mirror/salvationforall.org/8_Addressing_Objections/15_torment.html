<h1>
    What About Torment?
</h1>
<p>
    The word “torment” has such a negative connotation that most people
    immediately consider it to be purposeless torture. It evokes images of
    medieval torture devices and sadistic cruelty. The fact that it is used in
    Revelation in describing the lake of fire can therefore be a stumbling
    block to understanding both the biblical reality of salvation for all
    people, and God’s goodness. For these reasons, the meaning of the word
    “torment” in the original Greek must be addressed. Although a rather
    thorough exposition of its symbolic meaning in Revelation 14 was discussed
    in an earlier chapter on symbolism, there are several aspects of the word
    that merit further discussion.
</p>
<p>
    As we saw in our earlier discussion on symbolism
    <a href="../4_Symbolism/2_fireandworms.html">
        here</a>, the Greek word translated as torment is <em>basanízō</em>. As a reminder
of its meaning, let’s look once again at the first entry for<em> basanízō</em> in    <a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/928.htm">Thayer's Greek Lexicon</a>:
</p>
<p>
    1. properly, to test (metals) by the touchstone.
</p>
<p>
You may also recall that <em>basanízō</em> comes from the word "<em>básanos</em> – originally, a black, silicon-based stone used as "a
touchstone" to test the purity of precious metals (like silver and gold)" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/931.htm">HELPS Word-studies</a>).
</p>
<p>
    We also discovered that <em>basanízō</em> did <em>also</em> come to
    eventually be used of torture that was used to extract the truth from
    slaves, reflecting the Greek concept that truth was hidden inside the body
    and could be drawn out through such methods.
</p>
<p>
    When combined with the rest of the symbolism of the lake of fire, it is
    most reasonable to see <em>basanízō</em> in terms of a testing for
    authenticity and purity as those in the fire experience its purifying
    effects. Indeed, it ultimately does lead to the truth as well, to the
    realization that “only in the Lord are righteousness and strength” as every
    knee bows and every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, to God’s
    glory (Isaiah 45:23-24, Philippians 2:10-11).
</p>
<p>
    In spite of this evidence, I think that some people will still be unsure
    that such an interpretation can be made because of the powerful
    connotations of the word “torment” in English. For this reason, let’s look
    at the word <em>basanízō</em> in other biblical contexts. As we do, we will
see that the word is much more nuanced than the English translation allows.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<h4>
    <em>Basanízō</em>
    and Illness
</h4>
<h3>
    Matthew 8:5-7 (ESV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing
    to him, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering (<a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomenos_928.htm"
        title="basanizomenos: tormented" class="auto-style1"
    ><em>basanizomenos</em></a>/ βασανιζόμενος) terribly.” And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
	</blockquote>
	<p>Notice that in this context, we see <em>basanízō</em> being used to
    describe the suffering of a man due to illness. We also see Jesus' response
    of compassion, “I will come and heal him.” Remember, this is the same Jesus
who is the Lamb of God in the presence of whom the wicked will experience    <em>basanízō</em>. Will His compassion be gone? His mercy on the servant of
    a Roman centurion (a bitter enemy of the Jewish people) suggests otherwise.
    His love and compassion for the lost and the sick does not end, because his
    love never ends. As He said, "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but
    the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17).
    Will the Great Physician stop healing those who are suffering with the
    sickness of sin just because they have died? Is it not more consistent with
    His merciful character to see the trial and testing of the lake of fire as
    tools in the hands of a skilled surgeon who ultimately makes His patients
    healthy?
</p>
	<div class="box">
		As a reminder, the different forms of Greek words are called
    inflections and are used to make the word fit grammatically. Greek words
    take their meaning from their stem (the beginning of the word) and are
    inflected by the ending.
    <em>
        <a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomenos_928.htm"
            title="basanizomenos: tormented"
        >
            Basanizomenos
        </a>
    </em>
    is an inflection of <em>basanízō </em>and has the same meaning.
</div>
<h4>
    <em>Basanízō </em>
    and the Storm
</h4>
<h3>
    Matthew 14:22-25 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to
    the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. And when He had sent the
    multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. Now when
    evening came, He was alone there. But the boat was now in the middle of the
    sea, tossed (<a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomenon_928.htm"
        title="basanizomenon: tossed" class="auto-style1"
    ><em>basanizomenon</em></a>/βασανιζόμενον) by the waves, for the wind was contrary. 
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the
    sea.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this context, we see <em>basanízō</em> referring to being tossed by the
    waves and wind. This is a trial, to be sure, but has a very different sense
    than “torture.” The disciples likely experienced fear and struggle, but
    there is no maliciousness described in this event. Instead we see that
    Jesus meets them in their trial, showing His power and bringing them
comfort in the midst of a difficult circumstance. In the midst of the    <em>basanízō</em> experienced by the boat, we find Christ walking on the
    water and meeting people where they were, in their struggle and doubt.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<h3>
    Mark 6:48-51 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Then He saw them straining (<em><a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomenous_928.htm"
            title="basanizomenous: straining" class="auto-style1"
        >basanizomenous</a></em>/βασανιζομένους) at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the
    fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would
    have passed them by. And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they
    supposed it was a ghost, and cried out; for they all saw Him and were
    troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, “Be of good
    cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.” Then He went up into the boat to them,
    and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond
    measure, and marveled.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this passage, we see an even clearer picture of the struggle experienced
    by Jesus’ disciples during the storm. This time it is not the boat being
    tossed that is described, but rather the straining (<em><a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomenous_928.htm"
            title="basanizomenous: straining" class="auto-style1"
        >basanizomenous</a></em>) of the disciples themselves against the wind and waves. Again, the idea
    of vindictive torture is completely foreign to the context of the story.
    Instead, we see Christ declaring “be of good cheer! It is I; do not be
    afraid.” And then He calms the storm, bringing rest to their weary souls.
    Jesus is the solution to the <em>basanízō</em> once again, bringing
    gladness and peace while displaying His awesome power.
</p>
<h4>
    <em>Basanízō</em>
    of a Righteous Soul
</h4>
<h3>
    2 Peter 2:6-9 (NIV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		...if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes,
    and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; and if
    he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct
    of the lawless (for that righteous man, living among them day after day,
    was tormented (<a
        href="http://biblehub.com/greek/ebasanizen_928.htm"
        title="ebasanizen: tormented"
    >ebasanizen
    </a>
    / ἐβασάνιζεν) in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—
    if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and
    to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This passage is quite interesting in that the <em>basanízō</em> is being
    experienced by Lot, who was distressed by the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. In
    this case, we see the idea of <em>basanízō</em> being used to describe an
    intense feeling of grief by the righteous about evil. Once again,
    retributive torture is not an appropriate understanding of the word.
    Instead, Lot is bothered by the evil deeds committed by those around him.
</p>
<p>
    Sodom and Gomorrah, however, do not experience <em>basanízō </em>in this
    context. Instead we see that their destruction serves as “an example of
    what is going to happen to the ungodly.” If we want to interpret this
    statement accurately, we should consider carefully what actually happened
    to Sodom and Gomorrah. Were these cities tormented endlessly in the
    Biblical account in Genesis?
</p>
<p>
    The answer is no.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, these cities were literally destroyed because of their great
    wickedness. In Genesis 18:20, we are told that “the outcry against Sodom
    and Gomorrah [was] so great and their sin so grievous” that God decided to
    act. It seems that the outcry against Sodom was because of its arrogance
    and oppressiveness. In Ezekiel 16:49 it says that the sin of Sodom was that
    “she and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not
    help the poor and needy.” So the destruction of Sodom was not purposeless,
    but rather purposeful: it cleansed the world of a place of oppressive evil.
    I think that we can understand this as being a righteous judgment. Indeed,
    people often wonder why God doesn’t step in and remove evil from power, and
    it is rare to hear someone condemn the actions of soldiers in World War II
    who fought to rid the world of the violent oppression of the Nazis.
    Destroying evil can be necessary.
</p>
<p>
    But is this destruction of evil purely retributive or is there a deeper
    significance, a redemptive purpose? The redemption of Sodom as described in
    Ezekiel suggests the latter. Consider
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16:53&amp;version=ESV" class="auto-style1"
    >
        Ezekiel 16:53</a>, which states that God “will <strong>restore</strong> their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and
    her daughters…” The Genesis account leaves little doubt that Sodom was
    utterly destroyed. How then can its fortunes be restored?
</p>
<p>
    I think the answer lies in the reality that we have not yet experienced the
    completion of God’s purpose to unite all in Christ at the fullness of time
    as described in Ephesians 1. The physical destruction of Sodom, it seems,
    was only a temporary destruction, a destruction of the flesh similar to
    that described in 1 Peter 4:6:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that
    though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the
    spirit the way God does.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Though wicked Sodom was judged in the flesh, could it be that they too
    might one day live in the spirit? Could it be that God’s righteous judgment
    of their evil ways had a purpose, beyond simply killing people? Is it
    possible that God uses judgment and punishment to teach us righteousness? I
    believe this is, in fact, what the Bible is teaching. In this way, we see
    that Sodom is an example of God’s righteous judgment that awaits all who do
    evil. It is severe, but it is just and purposeful, resulting in repentance
    and restoration.

<h4>
    <em>Basanízō</em>
    and Birthpains
</h4>
<h3>
    Revelation 12:1-2,5 (NKJV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the
    moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. Then being
    with child, she cried out in labor and in pain (<em><a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomene__928.htm"
            title="basanizomenē: being in pain"
        >basanizomenē
        </a>
    </em>
    /βασανιζομένη) to give birth… She bore a male Child who was to rule all
    nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His
    throne.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this part of Revelation, we see a sign in heaven appearing of a woman in
    labor. It seems quite clear that the woman is giving birth to Christ, the
    “male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron” who was “caught
    up to God and His throne.” Notice that the pain of this birthing process is
    <em>
        <a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanizomene__928.htm"
            title="basanizomenē: being in pain" class="auto-style1"
        >
            basanizomenē</a></em>, an inflection of <em>basanízō</em>. Childbirth is certainly very painful
(as any woman who has experienced it can attest), but it is    <em>not purposeless or vindictive.</em> It results in something good, the
    bringing forth of new life. In fact, in this case, it involved birth of the
Savior of all people who “gives <strong>life</strong> to    <strong>the</strong> <strong>world”</strong> (1 Timothy 4:10, John 6:33,
    51).
</p>
<p>
It is also worth noting that Jesus is “the way, the    <strong>truth, </strong>and the<strong> life</strong>” (John 14:6). You may
    recall that <em>basanízō </em>as torture was used by the ancient Greeks in
    order to extract truth for testimony in legal cases. Interestingly, the
    agony of the woman’s labor pains brings forth not only the life of Christ,
but also the truth of Christ. Truth and life come to a lost world through    <em>basanízō</em>. So, once again, we see <em>basanízō </em>being used in
    the biblical context, and once again there is no indication that it means
retributive torture. Instead, we see it as    <em>the means through which salvation is brought</em>.
</p>
<h4>
    <em>Basanízō</em>
    as Judgment “in Like Measure”
</h4>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:7 (ESV)
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
    <br/>
    so give her <strong>a like measure</strong> of torment (<em><a
            href="http://biblehub.com/greek/basanismon_929.htm"
            title="basanismon: torment"
        >basanismon
        </a>
    </em>
    /βασανισμὸν) and mourning,
    <br/>
    since in her heart she says,
    <br/>
    ‘I sit as a queen,
    <br/>
    I am no widow,
    <br/>
    and mourning I shall never see.’
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this final biblical example of <em>basanízō</em>, we do see it used in
    terms of judgment. It is worth noting, however, that the other biblical
    contexts that we’ve looked at so far do not use it of judgment or
    punishment. So, it does not uniformly have this sense. Nevertheless, here
    it does, and it is describing the judgment of Babylon for extreme arrogance
    and self-indulgence. So the question must be asked, does this refer to
    eternal torment?
</p>
<p>
    It seems that such an interpretation is prohibited. It must be noted that
    the punishment is given “in like measure” to the self-glorifying
    luxuriating of Babylon. In other words, to the same extent that Babylon
    sinned, she would be paid back with torment and mourning. It is not
    reasonable to assert that Babylon was infinitely and eternally
    self-indulgent. This is simply not possible. Extremely wicked, yes.
    Infinitely wicked, impossible.
</p>
<p>
    So we see God punishes Babylon righteously and fairly, “in like measure”
    for the greatness of her sin. The judgment is very serious, because the
    wickedness was very serious, but we have no indication that it is eternal.
    Instead, the context indicates the opposite.
</p>
<p>
    And what might be the purpose of such a judgment, of inflicting Bablyon
    with <em>basanismós </em>and mourning? Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 2:11-12
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The haughty looks of man shall be brought low,
    <br/>
    and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled,
    <br/>
    and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		For the Lord of hosts has a day
    <br/>
    against all that is proud and lofty,
    <br/>
    against all that is lifted up—and it shall be brought low;
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Matthew 23:12
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be
    exalted.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Babylon seems to be symbolic of the world system that promotes arrogance,
    reliance on material wealth, and immorality. The judgment and destruction
    of this system results in the humbling of those who relied on it. A careful
    reading of the text suggests that the torment of Babylon is not about
    tormenting people, but about destroying a corrupt world system. Here is a
    description describing the reasons for its fall:
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:3-4
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For all nations have drunk
    <br/>
    the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,
    <br/>
    and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her,
    <br/>
    and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her
    luxurious living.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“<strong>Come out of her</strong>, my people,
    <br/>
    lest you take part in her sins,
    <br/>
    lest you share in her plagues;"</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that the voice from heaven is calling people out of Babylon. The
    punishment, it seems, is for the system rather than for the people. And
    before you begin to believe that “my people” only refers to Christ
    followers, consider who stands far off from Babylon when it is destroyed.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:9-10a
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		And the
    <strong>
        kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury
        with her</strong>, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning.    <strong>They will stand far off</strong>…
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:15
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The
    <strong>
        merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far
        off</strong>, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud…
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:17-18
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For in a single hour all this wealth has been laid waste.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		And all <strong>shipmasters</strong> and<strong> seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea</strong>,    <strong>stood far off</strong> and cried out as they saw the smoke of her
    burning,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“What city was like the great city?”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that the very people who committed immorality and profited from the
    corrupt city are <em>standing far off</em>, mourning its judgment. All of
    their trust had been placed in Babylon but now Babylon is violently
    destroyed. All the arrogant pride in their self-sufficiency is laid waste.
    Those who exalted themselves are humbled and the haughty looks of man are
    brought low. Babylon is destroyed.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 18:21
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it
    into the sea, saying,
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		“So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence,
    <br/>
    and <strong>will be found no more</strong>…”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    We see therefore that the violent destruction and torment of Babylon
    results in its utter annihilation. The torment does not continue forever,
    but rather results in the complete extinction of its immorality as it “will
    be found no more.” Corrupt greed, arrogance, and all of the evils
    perpetrated by the world system will be done away with and no longer exist.
    This is good news and is necessary to bring forth “a new heaven and a new
    earth, where righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13).
</p>
	<div class="box">
		In Revelation 18:7 the noun <em>basanismós </em>is used rather
than the verb <em>basanízō</em>. <em>Basanismós </em>comes from    <em>basanízō </em>and has the same meaning but in noun form.
	</div>
<h4>
    <em>Básanos</em>
    <em> </em>
    in Ancient Greek Literature
</h4>
<p>
    One final example of the use of <em>básanos</em> provides a little more
    insight into the word. Consider the following explanation by Paige DuBois
    (Distinguished Professor of Classics and Comparative Literature at UC San
    Diego), of the usage of the word in the ancient Greek work Theognis:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The work of "Theognis"—probably a collective effort produced over time in
    this period, the sixth century B.C.E., a time of aristocratic factionalism,
    tyranny, oligarchies, strife between rich and poor—is anxiously concerned
    with the purity and loyalty of friends; "it is difficult to tell a false
    friend from a true one."<sup>4</sup> Greed, the desire for gain, leads in
    the poet's view to betrayal of aristocratic values, of traditional sympotic
    bonds forged at drinking parties, of fidelity to one's faithful companions.
    Theognis uses the word <em>basanos </em>metaphorically to denote a test, a
    trial to determine whether something is genuine or real, and often employs
    the word in the context of friendship. For example:
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Seek as I will, I can find no man like myself that is a true comrade    <em>[piston hetairon] </em>free of guile; and when I am put to the test and
    tried <em>[es basanon d'elthon paratribomenos te] </em>even as gold is
    tried beside lead the mark <em>[tupos] </em>of pre-eminence is upon me.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		(DuBois 1991)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see the idea of <em>básanos</em> being used to test the
    authenticity of friendship. It is not about torture at all but rather about
    testing to see if someone is a true friend. Is it not possible that this is
    also the sense in which it is used of judgment in the lake of fire—as a
    test to see if at last the enemies of Christ have been redeemed through
    refining fire and made true friends? This idea is certainly very reasonable
    and is consistent with a Greek understanding of <em>básanos</em>, with the
    biblical symbolic meaning of fire, and with God’s clearly stated purpose to
    unite all in Christ “as a plan for the fullness of time” (Ephesians 1:10).
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion
</h4>
<p>
    The Greek words <em>básanos</em> and <em>basanizo</em> which are sometimes
    translated as “torment” have a much richer meaning in the original Greek
    than is typically understood in English. They can be used to describe the
    buffeting of waves in a storm as well as the straining of the disciples
    tossed by them. But in this storm, Jesus arrives to comfort, alleviate
    fears, and save. They can also be used to describe the pains of childbirth
    through which the Savior of the world entered into it, bringing light and
    truth, or the suffering of illness that He compassionately cures. The
vexation of the righteous over evil can also be described by    <em>basanizo</em>,<em> </em>as well as the process through which this
    systemic evil is ultimately completely abolished. And finally we see that
    it is used to test the genuineness of friendship. It need not be
    purposeless, cruel, or vindictive because God is not purposeless, cruel, or
    vindictive. His judgments are righteous and He longs to be gracious and
    show compassion <em>because</em> He is a God of justice, as Isaiah 30:18
    tells us. Could it be that the human desire to interpret <em>basanizo</em>
    as never-ending torture stems not from God’s heart but from the wickedness
    and cruelty of the human heart?
</p>
<p>
    Consider once again Jonah’s response to the repentance of the wicked
    Assyrian city of Nineveh:
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    <u>Jonah 4:1-4</u>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		But it <strong>greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry</strong>. He
    prayed to the Lord and said, “Please Lord, was not this what I said while I
    was still in my own country? Therefore
    <strong>
        in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I knew that You are
        a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in
        lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity.
    </strong>
    Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for death is better to
    me than life.” The Lord said, “Do you have good reason to be angry?”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    God wanted Nineveh to be saved. He longed for their repentance. Jonah
    wanted Nineveh to be destroyed and was angry that God was gracious and
    compassionate. Jonah knew God well intellectually, knowing that He is “a
    gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abundant in
    lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity,” but Jonah’s heart
    was far from His. Jonah did not want salvation for others and that is the
    very reason why He didn’t go to Nineveh: he <em>knew</em> that God would
    save them in spite of his vengeful wishes otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    In insisting on eternal conscious torment, does the church exhibit God’s
    heart, or Jonah’s? When people say that God <em>must</em> torture people
    endlessly to get vengeance for their sin, are they making God into their
    own image: cruel, vindictive, sadistic and unforgiving? People have, after
    all, displayed these character traits throughout human history. Consider the
    wars, the oppressions, the feuds, and the torture devices that man has
    devised. Consider the grudges, even between family members, in which past
    slights are never forgiven and people refuse to forgive or even speak to
    one another. Is not the heart of man “deceitful above all things, and
    desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9).
</p>
<p>
    What is man like?
</p>
<p>
    What is God like?
</p>
<p>
    Who is more likely to devise the doctrine of eternal conscious torment?
</p>
<p>
    Who is willing and able to save?
</p>
<p>
    Think about these questions biblically. Think about them deeply and
    honestly. If you do, I have little doubt that you will find man’s cruelty
    and failure to love one another, and God’s incredible mercy, goodness and
    grace as dominant biblical themes. You will also see God’s amazing
    sovereign power to change even the hardest of hearts through His deep love.
    I want to be like Him, not like Jonah, and hope you do too.
