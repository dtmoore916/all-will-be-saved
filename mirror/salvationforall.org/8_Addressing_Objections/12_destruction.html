<h1>
    Addressing Objections: What About Destruction?
</h1>
<p>
    Because of the dominance of the hell paradigm in most churches today, many
    people read the doctrine into practically any passage that refers to
    destruction or death. So the assumption that is being made is that
    destruction and death are synonymous with endless torment in hell. Let’s
    now examine whether this assumption is valid, using the Scriptures as our
    guide. We will begin with a passage that supporters of the doctrine of hell
    like to cite:
</p>
<h3>
    2 Thessalonians 1:4-10 (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your
    steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions
    that you are enduring.
<br>
<br>
    This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be
    considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—
    since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who
    afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us,
    when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in
    flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on
    those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the
    punishment of eternal (<em>aiōnion</em>) destruction (<em>olethron</em>),
    away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, when he
    comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at
    among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.
</blockquote>
<p>
    On the surface, it might appear to you that eternal damnation is being
    described, but if we truly love God with all our minds and dig deeper, we
    once again see that the word translated as “eternal” is <em>aiōnion</em>.
    Hopefully, it is clear to you by now that <em>aiōnion</em> need not mean
    eternal and that this usage is in fact contradicted by numerous uses of the
    word in the Bible itself as well as Greek literature. So there is no good
    reason to assume that the destruction goes on forever.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to remember that I am in no way disputing that God
    will judge the wicked for the evil they have done. In the context of this
    passage, Paul is referring to those who are persecuting the church in
    Thessalonica. It is worth noting at this point that first century
    persecution of Christians was often brutal. Christians were eaten alive by
    lions to please the masses, beheaded, crucified, and even burned to light
    the city of Rome by Nero. The persecutors of these Christians did many evil
    things. So Paul is assuring them that justice will be done by God and that
    this does involve punishment and destruction for their persecutors.&nbsp; So
    what is this destruction exactly? I think it is most reasonable to believe
    that it is the destruction of the flesh (wicked human nature). After all, eternal, unending
    torment doesn’t actually destroy anything. It just sweeps the problem under
    the rug by consigning people by the billions to a perpetual penal colony of
    wickedness.
</p>
	<div class="box">
		Although the ESV and some other versions say that this destruction will occur "away from" 
	or "separated from" the presence of the Lord, the Greek word being translated this way is <em>apo</em>, which simply means "from."&nbsp; 
	It seems in this instance that <em>apo</em> means "originating from" in 
	terms of causal origin.&nbsp; In other words, the destruction <em>comes from 
	God</em> in that it is <em>caused</em> by Him).&nbsp;  This is, in fact, a key definition given for the word 
	<em>apo</em> and is the one that 
	<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/575.htm">Thayer's Greek Lexicon</a> specifically associates with the term in 2 Thessalonians 1:9 
	(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/575.htm">definition II, 2, d</a> or 
	just search "2 Thessalonians" to see this).&nbsp;&nbsp; That this is the 
	proper understanding of <em>apo</em> in this passage is clear if we consider the 
	broader biblical context. If we interpret this destruction as referring to 
	the lake of fire of the book of Revelation, we see that people are not 
	separated from the presence of the Lord in the lake of fire but rather that 
	they are <em>in His presence</em>. As Revelation 14:10 states, those in the lake of 
	fire will be "in the presence of the Lamb."&nbsp; Therefore, interpreting 
		the destruction of the wicked as originating from God's presence and 
		glory seems most reasonable.&nbsp; The idea of separation does<em> not</em> 
		since it is specifically contradicted in Revelation 14:10.</div>
<p>
    Let’s now see if we have any evidence of destruction being used to describe
    the destruction of the flesh (evil natures) of the wicked as I just
    mentioned:
</p>
<h3>
    1 Corinthians 5:1-5
</h3>
<blockquote>
    It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a
    kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s
    wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has
    done this be removed from among you.
<br>
<br>
    For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I
    have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. When you
    are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with
the power of our Lord Jesus, you are to deliver this man to Satan<strong> for the destruction </strong>(<em>olethron/</em> ὄλεθρον)    <strong> of the flesh</strong>, so that his spirit may be saved in the day
    of the Lord.
    <strong>
        <em>
            <sup>
                <a
                    href="http://biblehub.com/esv/1_corinthians/5.htm#footnotes"
                    title="Some manuscripts add Jesus"
                >
                </a>
            </sup>
        </em>
    </strong>
    <em> </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    I guess it turns out that Paul uses the term destruction (<em>olethron</em>) in exactly that way. He is encouraging the church to allow for the
    destruction of this man’s flesh for a purpose, “so that his spirit may be
    saved in the day of the Lord.” It is interesting to note that God even uses
    Satan to accomplish this work of destruction, bending even Satan’s vain
    attempts at permanent destruction into hopeful redemption. Evil is
destroyed, not the man himself. As Psalm 1:6 tells us, “<em>the way of the wicked</em> will perish.” Why do we assume that this
    man’s wickedness can be redeemed by destruction but that others cannot?
    There is simply no good reason to make this assumption. It is the same word
    in both of Paul’s letters. And it is the same God who wants to save this
    Corinthian man who is the Savior of all people. His will and purpose do not
    change.
</p>
<p>
    With this in mind, consider Jesus’ stated purpose once again, and how 
	it contrasts with his disciples misunderstanding of his mission:
</p>
<h3>
    Luke 9:51-56
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that
    He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem, and sent messengers before
    His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to
prepare for Him. But they did not receive Him, because His face was    <em>set</em> for the journey to Jerusalem. And when His disciples James and
    John saw <em>this,</em> they said, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to
    come down from heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?”
<br>
<br>
    But He turned and rebuked them, and said, “You do not know what manner of
spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy (from <a href="http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/575.htm">apo</a> and same as    <a href="http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3639.htm">olethros</a> according
    to the <a href="http://biblehub.com/lexicon/luke/9-56.htm">NASB lexicon</a>
    ) men’s lives but to save <em>them.</em>” And they went to another village.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see the disciples wanting destruction of those who do not accept
    Jesus, but Jesus rebukes them and repeats that His purpose is not to
    destroy but to save men’s lives. So, even if destruction does happen
    because of sin and evil, Jesus’ purpose in it is ultimate salvation. This
    is what he came for. Those who want permanent destruction and unending
    torment are like James and John who did “not know what manner of spirit”
    they were of. Though they were trying to follow Christ, they were
    misguided. Let’s not make the same mistake!
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to note that there are other words translated
    destruction and that saying that they all mean hell is utter nonsense.
    Let’s consider some verses that show this to be true.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy+6:9&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 Timothy 6:9-</a>10 (NIV)</h3>
<blockquote>
    Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into 
	<strong>ruin</strong> (<em>olethron</em>) and <strong>destruction </strong>(<em>apōleian</em>). 
	For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for 
	money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.</blockquote>
<p>
    In this passage, Paul is writing to believers and encouraging them to flee
    from the love of money. Why? Because it causes ruin and destruction. Does
    this mean that believers that are tempted by wealth go to hell? No, it
    doesn’t. Instead, it means that the pursuit of wealth is damaging in the
    life of the believer and causes many problems.&nbsp; It causes people to 
	lose sight of the gospel, and experience "many griefs."&nbsp; These griefs 
	are clearly described as being in the past tense and do not refer in context 
	to future destruction.&nbsp; Rather, the destruction has already transpired.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Consider also the following verses from the book of Galatians:
</p>
<h3>
    Galatians 6:7-8
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever
sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction (<em>phthoran</em>); whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will
    reap eternal life.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, Paul is writing to believers and encouraging them to live to please
    the Spirit rather than the flesh. Does this mean that believers who sin go
    to eternal hell? Haven’t we all sought to please our sinful natures and
    sometimes still do? Hopefully, as we continue to be sanctified this becomes
    less common, but I’ve never met a Christian who doesn’t sometimes struggle
    with sin. Indeed, Paul tells us of the reality of this struggle in his own
    life:
</p>
<h3>
    Romans 7:15-25
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I
    do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the
    law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that
    dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
    flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to
    carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want
    is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I
    who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
<br>
<br>
    So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at
    hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my
    members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me
    captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am!
    Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus
    Christ our Lord!...
</blockquote>
<p>
    And the apostle John tells us that “if we claim to be without sin, we
    deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us” (I John 1:8).
</p>
<p>
    So it is fair to say that we all (even believers) sometimes sow to please
    our flesh and reap destruction. In other words, sinning is harmful and it
    destroys. It makes it difficult to follow Christ and to love others when we
    selfishly seek to please our sinful natures. This is destructive to us and
    to our mission, so we are encouraged instead to make every effort to
    “please the Spirit,” and “reap eternal life.” Now just as a reminder, Jesus
    defined eternal life for us. Here are His words once again:
</p>
<h3>
    John 17:3
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus
    Christ, whom you have sent.
</blockquote>
<p>
    By seeking to please the Spirit, we come to know the only true God and
    Jesus Christ! This is eternal life. Those who wish to reduce the concept to
    duration are missing the point that Jesus Himself made. And saying that
    destruction must last forever because it is contrasted with eternal life is
    also misguided. If we truly want a valid contrast, we would say that
    destruction is the opposite of knowing God and Christ (i.e. <em>not</em>
    knowing Him). So, we experience destruction when we turn away from knowing
    God, for whatever reason.
</p>
<p>
    It is this same concept of destruction that is apparent in the following
    verses:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 7:12-13
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for
    this is the Law and the Prophets.
<br>
<br>
    “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that
    leads to destruction (<em>apōleian</em>), and those who enter by it are
    many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and
    those who find it are few.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that we see that many choose the destructive path but few follow the
    narrow way that leads to life. Does this mean that only a few people are
    saved but the rest go to eternal hell? Let’s consider another biblical
    passage to see if this interpretation is reasonable:
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 7:9-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could
    number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages,
    standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes,
    with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice,
    “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now I’m no math wizard, but “a multitude that no one could number
    [count]” doesn’t sound like only a few. Not only this, but we see that the
    multitude is made up of people “from every nation, from all tribes and
    peoples and languages.” So saying that only a few make it to heaven and
    most go to hell is a misinterpretation of Matthew 7. Instead, it is quite
    apparent that it is discussing the fact that most people make a lot of
    destructive choices (of astounding variety) rather than obey Christ’s
    command to do unto others as you’d like them to do to you.
</p>

<h4>
    Destruction Can Mean Actual Destruction
</h4>
<p>
    The word translated destruction can also refer to actual destruction and
    death. Consider the following:
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 2:13
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
    in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to
    Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for
    the child, to destroy (<em>apolesai</em>) him.”
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Matthew 12:14
</h3>
<blockquote>
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy (<em>apolesōsin</em>) him.
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is apparent from both of these passages that the meaning of the word is
    literal destruction. In other words, Herod and the Pharisees both wanted to
    kill Jesus. They did not want to torment Him eternally, but to destroy Him
    physically. Indeed, this is exactly what they conspired to do. Therefore,
    assuming destruction to be eternal torment is not supported at all by its
    usage in these contexts.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s look at another passage to see this concept of destruction.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter+3:7&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        2 Peter 3:7-13
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long
    ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of
    God, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged
    with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that
    now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and
    destruction (<em>apōleias</em>) of the ungodly.
<br>
<br>
    But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is
    as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow
    to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
    not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
    But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will
    pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and
    dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.
<br>
<br>
    Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought
    you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the
    coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire
    and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! But
    according to his promise
    <strong>
        we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness
        dwells
    </strong>
    .
</blockquote>
<p>
    Prior to this passage, Peter once again references Noah’s flood as an
    example. He is saying that in a similar way that the world of Noah was
    destroyed so that it could be purified, the present world and its evils
    will be destroyed. By the way, it is worth noting that Noah’s world was not
    eternally tormented, but rather literally destroyed. In similar fashion,
    our present world won’t be eternally tormented, but rather destroyed.
</p>
<p>
    But the end is not destruction. The end is redemption and a “new heavens
    and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.” Notice also that this
    passage explains that this destruction has not occurred yet because God “is
    patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
    reach repentance.” Once again, we see God’s redemptive purpose shining
    through in a passage about destruction. He wants all to reach repentance
    and gives us time to reach it in this life. And if we don’t, there is no
    reason to believe that He is powerless to fulfill his will simply because
    we’ve experienced biological death.
</p>
<h4>
    Destruction Can Mean Being Lost (and then Found)
</h4>
<p>
    I imagine that many people are not aware of this, but the same root word 
	(<em><a href="http://biblehub.com/greek/622.htm">apollumi</a></em>)
    that is often translated as “destruction” is also often translated as
    “lost.” Below we will see it’s usage in a series of parables in the book of
    Luke. Determine for yourself if the word is best thought of as a permanent
    destruction in hell. I have made the words translated as lost bold so they
    are easy to see. You should notice that they are all forms of the
    same root word, beginning with the same root “<em>apo</em>.”</p>
	<div class="box">
    As a reminder, you can independently confirm the word origins discussed

<h3>
    Luke 15
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. And
    the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, “This man receives sinners
    and eats with them.”
<br>
<br>
    So he told them this parable: “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if
he has <strong>lost (</strong><strong><em>apolesas)</em></strong><em> </em>one of them, does not leave the
ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is    <strong>lost (</strong><strong><em>apolōlos</em></strong><strong>)</strong>, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders,
    rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his
    neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that
was <strong>lost (</strong><strong><em>apolōlos</em>)</strong><strong>.</strong>’&nbsp; Just so, I tell you, there will be
    more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine
    righteous persons who need no repentance.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    The Parable of the Lost Coin
</h4>

“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she <strong>loses (<em>apolesē</em></strong><strong>)</strong> one coin, does not
    light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?
    And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors,
saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had    <strong>lost (</strong><strong><em>apōlesa</em></strong><strong>)</strong>.’ Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one
    sinner who repents.”
<br>
<br>
<h4>
    The Parable of the Prodigal Son
</h4>

    And he said, “There was a man who had two sons. And the younger of them
    said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of property that is coming
    to me.’ And he divided his property between them. Not many days later, the
    younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and
    there he squandered his property in reckless living.&nbsp; And when he had spent
    everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in
    need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that
    country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. And he was longing to
    be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.
<br>
<br>
    “But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired
    servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! I will
    arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned
    against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
    Treat me as one of your hired servants.”’ And he arose and came to his
    father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt
    compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to
    him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer
    worthy to be called your son.’&nbsp; But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring
    quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and
    shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat
    and celebrate. For this my son was dead (<em>nekros</em>), and is alive
again; he was <strong>lost (</strong><strong><em>apolōlōs</em>)</strong>, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.
<br>
<br>
    “Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the
    house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and
    asked what these things meant. And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come,
    and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him
    back safe and sound.’ But he was angry and refused to go in. His father
    came out and entreated him, but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many
    years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never
    gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this
    son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you
    killed the fattened calf for him!’ And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always
    with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be
    glad, for this your brother was dead (<em>nekros</em>), and is alive; he
was <strong>lost </strong>(<strong><em>apolōlōs</em></strong>), and is found.’”
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, what do you think? Do these words denote permanent loss and
    destruction? Of course they do not. Notice that each time something or
    someone is lost (<strong><em>apolōlōs</em></strong>)<strong>, </strong>it
    is subsequently found! The lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son are
    all found and there is great rejoicing because of this. In the parable of
    the prodigal son, the Father goes so far to say that the son was not only
    lost but also dead! And yet the Father redeems Him! Death and destruction
    can’t stop the love of God from reaching His children. Nothing can stop
    Him! He will find us and redeem us from destruction. This is the very
    gospel. Let’s not miss it!
