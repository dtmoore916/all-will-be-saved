<h1>
    Alexandria: Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
    In order to avoid writing an entire book on the Alexandrian school, I will 
	endeavor to wrap up our study of it for now. It is readily apparent that the 
	school was very influential not only to those who were educated in it, but 
	also to those from other areas who visited the school to interact with its 
	scholars. The views of Clement, Origen, and Athanasius on the subject of universal
    reconciliation were very common in the early church, as we will continue to
    see. At times these views were surely passed on from the Alexandrian school
    to other places, but it is also true that they were arrived at
    independently as well, based on Scripture. We will soon see this was the
    case in the school of Antioch.
</p>
<p>
    But before moving on from the school of Alexandria, I will mention one more
    of its leaders because his story is particularly interesting: Didymus the
    Blind (circa 313-circa 398). According to all sources that I have seen,
    Didymus became blind by the age of four and was therefore unable to read
    the Scriptures for himself. Nevertheless, his desire to learn was so great
    that “he became one of the most learned men of his period,” according the
    Catholic Encyclopedia. This same source gives insight into how this
    remarkable man achieved such a feat, despite his inability to read:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Didymus studied with ardor, and his vigils were long and frequent, not for
    reading but for listening, that he might gain by hearing what others
    obtained by seeing. When the reader fell asleep for weariness, Didymus did
    not repose, but as it were chewed the cud (says Rufinus) of what he had
    heard, until he seemed to have inscribed it on the pages of his mind. Thus
    in a short time he amassed a vast knowledge of grammar, rhetoric, logic,
    music, arithmetic, and geometry, and a perfect familiarity with Holy
    Scripture. (Chapman 1908)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    His knowledge of scripture and incredible memory are confirmed by many
    sources. It is said that Jerome praised Didymus, saying that he "surpassed
    all of his day in knowledge of the Scriptures" (Hanson 1899). And Schaff
    writes that “He learned to write by means of wooden tablets in which the
    characters were engraved; and he became so familiar with the Holy
    Scriptures by listening to the church lessons, that he knew them almost all
    by heart” (Schaff 1910).
</p>
	<div class="box">
		Interesting fact: Because of his method of learning to read and
    write by “reading letters engraved into the surface of wood by touch,”
    Didymus is considered to be a forerunner of Braille (Lascaratos &amp;
    Marketos 1994).
</div>
<p>
    Undoubtedly, Didymus’ knowledge of Scripture was a primary reason for the great
    respect and admiration of his contemporaries and students. We are told by
    several sources that he was highly esteemed by Saint Athanasius, who
    appointed him as head of the Alexandrian catechetical school, knowing full
    well that he believed in universal reconciliation and that he was a
    follower of much of Origen’s teaching.&nbsp; This of course should not be 
	surprising, given Athanasius' clear agreement with universal reconciliation 
	which we described in the previous <a href="4b-alexandria-athanasius.html">
	chapter</a>.&nbsp; We also know that many well-known
    church leaders were his students, including Saint Gregory Nazianzen, Saint
    Jerome, Rufinus, Palladius, and Isidore. Schaff tells us that many of these
    men “sat at his feet with admiration” (See Schaff, and "Contributions to
    Christendom").
</p>
<p>
The Catholic Encyclopedia says that “He    prayed earnestly
    in his youth, we are told by Rufinus, not for the sight of his bodily eyes,
but for the illumination of the heart” and that “St. Jerome indeed
    habitually spoke of him not at "the blind" but as "the Seer" (or as other
    sources put it, "Didymus the Seeing") (Chapman 1908). That his prayer for
    illumination of the heart was answered seems confirmed by others who shared
    Jerome’s view about his spiritual vision. The highly respected monk, Saint
    Anthony of the Desert, said to him: “Do not be sad that you have no
    eyesight with which the animals, and even the insects, share, but remember
    that you have divine insight with which you can see the light of divinity”
    ("Contributions to Christendom").
</p>
	<div class="box">
		Saint Anthony was also known as Anthony the Great or Anthony of
the Desert is considered to be the “Father of All Monks” according to    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_the_Great">Wikipedia</a>,
    and is venerated as a saint in many Christian traditions. Didymus is also
    venerated as a saint by Eastern Orthodox and Coptic Orthodox Christians.
	</div>
<p>
    Didymus positive reputation was well-known even beyond Christian circles.
    The orator Libanius, himself not a Christian, wrote to an official in
    Egypt: "You cannot surely be ignorant of Didymus, unless you are ignorant
    of the great city wherein he has been night and day pouring out his
    learning for the good of others” (Chapman 1908).
</p>
<p>
    Modern scholars, too, esteem him as a highly devoted Christian who based
    his teaching on the Bible. Frances Young, a Cambridge-educated professor
    and “author of numerous books in patristics and New Testament studies”
    describes Didymus the Blind as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Didymus was a scholar and a teacher; but for all his academic attainments,
    he was essentially a pious monk and a conservative churchman. His
    scholarship was entirely devoted to the elucidation of scripture and the
    doctrines of the Church. In these areas of specialty, he displayed little
    originality, though he undoubtedly contributed to the consolidation of the
    orthodox position. His main source-book, his real inspiration, was the
    Bible, and in the long-term, it was as an exegete that he had some abiding
    influence (Young 2010).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Nevertheless, despite his renown, deep commitment to the faith, and sound 
	biblical exegesis, Didymus suffered a similar fate as Origen. His works were 
	posthumously anathematized and many of them lost to history.&nbsp; These 
	unwarranted anathemas were not due to his belief in universal 
	restoration, since in them "nothing is said in condemnation of his pronounced Universalism" (Hanson). It seems
    to be universally acknowledged, however, that he was a believer in the
    ultimate salvation of all people.&nbsp; Consider his own words: "In the liberation of 
	<em>all</em> no one remains a captive; at the time of the Lord's passion, he alone (the devil) was injured, who lost
	<em>all</em> the captives he was keeping" (Hanson, citing <em>Sermon Major de fide</em>. Migne, vol. XXVI, pp. 1263-1294).</p>
	<p>
    The Catholic Encyclopedia, however, seems
    somewhat confused about his views on this matter: </p>
	<blockquote>
		The doctrine of the "restitution of all things" is attributed to him by St.
    Jerome; but he speaks very often of eternal punishment … He is fond of
    explaining that God's punishments are remedial (Chapman 1908).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The source of this confusion is undoubtedly the fact that Didymus used and
    understood the term “eternal punishment” in the way it was understood by
    the Greeks as “<em>aionion</em> punishment” or punishment of the age to
come. It is likely that Didymus simply used the same words as Christ, (<em>kolasin aionion</em>) to describe the remedial punishment of people,
    taking them as they were intended. This is further proof that these Greek
    words did not mean “never-ending torture” to native Greek-speakers. The
    apparent contradiction of Didymus’ references to “eternal” punishment and
    the “restitution of all things” is thus easily resolved by understanding
    the meaning of the Greek words he employed as he understood them. Indeed,
    this is also the best way to resolve similar perceived conflicts in the
biblical texts. If you do not impose the incorrect view that    <em>aionion </em>has to mean “eternal,” the Bible verses that speak of
    universal reconciliation, unity, and subjection are quite easy to
    understand and harmonious with God’s righteous judgment. God is able to
    judge the whole world and still be its Savior. He is able to punish sin and
    still “reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things
    in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross”
    (Colossians 1:20).
</p>
<p>
    Didymus’ understood this harmony of judgment with universal salvation in
    the same manner as so many of the early Church Fathers. Judgment was
    purifying and purposeful, leading to unity, reconciliation and subjection
    to Christ. These views were based on the biblical texts and were very
    prevalent in the early church.
</p>
<p>
    J.W. Hanson points out that the works of the Alexandrian theologians and
    others who believed in universal salvation “are not from a few isolated
    authorities but from the most eminent in the church, and those who gave
    tone to theological thought, and shaped and gave expression to public
    opinion. There can be no doubt that they are true exponents of the
    doctrines of their day, and that man's universal deliverance from sin was
    the generally accepted view of human destiny, prevalent in the Alexandrine
    church from the death of the apostles to the end of the Fourth Century.”
</p>
<p>
    Hanson also cites the protestant German historian Johann Karl Ludwig
    Gieseler who accurately perceived that this belief was not exclusive to the
    Alexandrian school, but rather pervasive throughout the church:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Gieseler records that "the belief in the inalienable capability of
    improvement in all rational beings, and the limited duration of future
    punishment, was so general, even in the West, and among the opponents of
    Origen that, whatever may be said of its not having risen without the
    influence of Origen's school, it had become entirely independent of his
    system." So that doctrine may be said to have prevailed all over
    Christendom, East <a name="209"></a>and West, among "orthodox" and
    heterodox alike.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Based off of the primary source research I have completed, this estimation
    is certainly correct. Universal restoration was held, not just by the
    Alexandrians, but even by their theological opponents. To see just how true
    this is, we must now turn to our investigation of the other theological
    schools of the early church.
