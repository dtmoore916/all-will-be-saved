    History and Tradition
	Introduction</h1>

<h2>
    Traditions of men
</h2>
<h3>
    Mark 7:5-9
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		The Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk
    according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure
    hands?” And He said to them, “Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you
    hypocrites, as it is written:
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		‘This people honors Me with their lips,
    <br/>
    But their heart is far away from Me.
    <br/>
    ‘But in vain do they worship Me,
    <br/>
    Teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.’
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		He was also saying to them, “You are experts at setting aside the
    commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.”<u></u>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    I start out this chapter with the biblical quote above because a common
    argument for the doctrine of hell is that it is the historical, traditional
    view that has been held by the Church for hundreds of years. It is
    tradition.
</p>
<p>
    It is readily apparent from Jesus' teaching that tradition is not a good
    reason to hold to a doctrine. In fact, you might say that Jesus is quite
    harsh with the religious leaders on multiple occasions because they
    elevated their traditions above compassion for their fellow man.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11:46&amp;version=NIV"
    >
        Luke 11:46
    </a>
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load
    people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not
    lift one finger to help them.”
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Luke 13:14-17
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader
    said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on
    those days, not on the Sabbath.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath
    untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
    Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept
    bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what
    bound her?”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were
    delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Compassion for people was a hallmark of Jesus’ ministry. Jesus loved and
    cared for all people. His compassion was particularly evident toward
    sinners and the oppressed, but I believe the warnings to religious leaders
    that opposed Him were also made out of love. He wanted them to flee their
    oppressive traditional religious systems and come to Him, the true source
    of living water. I think He offers the same warning and plea to us today.
</p>
<p>
    The religious tradition of hell is, in my view, a prime example of a
    tradition that erodes away our compassion for others. If we believe that
    God consigns billions of people to eternal torment, how does that affect
    our view and treatment of them? Below are some statements from former
    church leaders (spanning several centuries) who staunchly supported the
    traditional doctrine of hell, as quoted from the late Dean of Canterbury,
    Frederic Farrar’s work. The first quote is from Thomas Aquinas’ <em>Summa
    Theologica</em>.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"That the saints may enjoy their beatitude more thoroughly, and give 
		more abundant thanks to God for it <em>
        (ut beatitudo sanctorum magis eis complaceat et de ea liberiores gratias
        Deo agant</em>), a perfect sight of the punishment of the damned is granted to them." —
    Summa iii. Suppl. Qu. 93, i.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		So too Peter Lombard, the Master of the Sentences, "Therefore the elect
    shall go forth…..to see the torments of the impious, seeing which they will
not be grieved, but will be satiated with joy (<em>non dolore efficientur, sed lactitia satiabuntur</em>), at the sight of
    the unutterable calamity of the impious." (Sentent. Iv. 50, ad fin.)
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		It is not wonderful that hosts of minor theologians should have repeated a
    sentiment for which they had such high authority.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Thus the German theologians of the "dogmatic" epoch all accept it. Luther,
    to the question whether the Blessed will not be saddened by seeing their
    nearest and dearest (<em>conjunctissimos</em>) tortured, answers, "Not the least in
    the world"; and Gerhard says that "the Blessed will see their friends and
    relations among the damned as often as they like (quoties cunque
    voluerint!) but without the least compassion."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		"The view of the misery of the damned," said Jonathan Edwards, "will double
    the ardour of the love and gratitude of the saints in heaven." (Works, vol.
    iv. Serm. xiii.) Boldicke, in his <em>Versuch einer Theodicee</em>, argued
    that eternal torments proved the beneficence of the Deity, because they
    would so greatly heighten the happiness of the elect! Andrew Welwood speaks
    of the saints as "overjoyed in beholding the vengeance of God," and their
    beholding of the smoke of the torment of the wicked as "a passing
    delectation."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		"This display of the divine character," said Samuel Hopkins, "will be most
    entertaining to all who love God, will give them the highest and most
    ineffable pleasure. Should the fire of this eternal punishment cease, it
    would in a great measure obscure the light of heaven, and put an end to a
    great part of the happiness and glory of the blessed." "The door of mercy
    will be shut," said Newcome in his Catechetical Sermons, "and all bowels of
    compassion denied, by God, who will laugh at their destruction; by angels
    and saints, who will rejoice when they see the vengeance; by their
    fellow-sufferer the devil, and the damned rejoicing over their misery.”
	</blockquote>
<h2>
    Commentary on the Theological Statements
</h2>
<p>
    Compare these statements to the compassion, forgiveness, and love evident
    in the Person of Jesus. Are they consistent with the character of Christ?
    Some of us may be surprised to see the statements of some of our
    “theological heroes” in regards to hell. While many of these men did
    contribute valuable insights to the Christian faith, insofar as these
    insights were actually <em>biblical</em>, it seems quite apparent that they
    also had a twisted sense of morality and justice. The statements above
    clearly show a seared conscience, a conscience bereft of moral sensitivity
    and compassion. How could these believers get to that point?
</p>
<p>
    I believe the traditional doctrine of hell is largely responsible. How can
    we view other human beings with compassion and love, if God views them with
    unmerciful, unrelenting hatred? If God is willing to torture the
    unrighteous forever, won’t his followers do the same to those that they
    perceive as unrighteous? History suggests that this is exactly what they
    did.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s now revisit the “love chapter” in 1 Corinthians and compare it to the
    quotes made by hellfire advocates.
</p>
<h3>
    1 Corinthians 13:4-8
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
    or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
    resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
    Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
    things.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Love never ends.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Do you see any characteristics of love in the statements of these men?
</p>
<p>
    Let’s also compare these statements to the fruit of the Spirit.
</p>
<h3>
    Galatians 5:22-23
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
    goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there
    is no law.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Do you see any fruits of the Holy Spirit evident in the statements made by
    the church leaders who made them? Why then do we feel compelled to blindly
    follow the doctrine of hell they ratified, especially when it contradicts
    so many clear, straightforward statements in the Bible?
</p>
<p>
    Finally, let’s consider Jesus’ statements on how we would know His
    followers.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13:34&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        John 13:34
    </a>
    -35
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have
    loved you, you also are to love one another. By this everyone will know
    that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”
	</blockquote>
<h3>
    Luke 6:27-28
</h3>
	<blockquote>
		“But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate
    you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.”
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The argument that the traditional doctrine must be right since it is the
    historical doctrine also falls flat based on the verses above. Much of the history
    of Christendom and the institutional church was not a history of love, but
    rather a history of brutality and oppression. The darkness and tortures of
    the Middle ages and the Inquisition, the murders of the Reformation, and
    the injustice of American slavery provide little evidence that the
    purported Christian leaders of those time periods were actually following
    Christ. Throughout these ages, how many people have been tortured, burned
    at the stake, persecuted and excommunicated? Investigate this for yourself.
    Yet all throughout, the doctrine of hell persisted and was actively
    promoted by these same leaders. Just because they’ve held to it, doesn’t
    make it right.
</p>
<p>
    Tradition and history are NOT reasons for promoting such a doctrine. If
    anything they suggest we should not.
</p>
<p>
    We know for a fact that official Church doctrine is not always correct. 
	Sometimes it is blatantly wrong as a result of faulty Bible interpretation.
    The story of Galileo Galilei is a prime example. He was declared a heretic
    by the institutional church because of his views that the Earth wasn't the
    center of the universe. Of course, we now know that Galileo was right.
    Nevertheless, he was condemned:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		On June 22, 1633, the Church handed down the following order: “We
    pronounce, judge, and declare, that you, the said Galileo… have rendered
    yourself vehemently suspected by this Holy Office of heresy, that is, of
    having believed and held the doctrine (which is false and contrary to the
    Holy and Divine Scriptures) that the sun is the center of the world, and
    that it does not move from east to west, and that the earth does move, and
    is not the center of the world.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Along with the order came the following penalty: “We order that by a public
    edict the book of Dialogues of Galileo Galilei be prohibited, and We
    condemn thee to the prison of this Holy Office during Our will and
    pleasure; and as a salutary penance We enjoin on thee that for the space of
    three years thou shalt recite once a week the Seven Penitential Psalms.”
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Galileo agreed not to teach the heresy anymore and spent the rest of his
    life under house arrest. It took more than 300 years for the Church to
    admit that Galileo was right and to clear his name of heresy ("Galileo is
    convicted of heresy" 2009).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice the misinterpretation of the passage that the sun moves from east to
    west. We now rightly interpret this to be figurative language. In fact, we
    still use this language today because it describes our everyday vantage
    point. No one ever says they saw a “beautiful rotation of their location on
    the earth away from direct exposure to the sun’s light waves.” We say it
    was a beautiful sunset, for obvious reasons.
</p>
<p>
    What shall we say then? Does the fact that the historical institution of
    the church has made some serious interpretive errors negate all doctrines
    of the church? I would argue no. The historical church has also done great
    good. Motivated by Scripture, believers from all denominations have cared
    for the sick, shown compassion to the needy, and believed in the atoning
    death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Many have experienced salvation,
    and many more continue to experience it because of the work of the church,
    which is us (Christ’s followers).
</p>
<p>
    Even if some have preached from the wrong motives, the gospel has spread in
    spite of those motives. As the Apostle Paul said,
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
    The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of
    the gospel. The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not
    sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. What then? Only
    that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed,
    and in that I rejoice (Philippians 1:15-18).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    We too can rejoice that Christ has been proclaimed, but now is the time to
    abandon the traditions of men that have made it so difficult for so many
    people to know God as He truly is. In this section, we will see how the
    current tradition of hell developed, and why the claim that it is “the
    historical doctrine” is false. We will also see that the conviction that
    all people will be ultimately saved is as old as the Church itself and was
    held by many of the most brilliant minds and ardent defenders of orthodoxy
    throughout history. Through careful examination of primary source documents
    and historical facts, it will become readily apparent that belief in the
    salvation of all people by Christ is not only biblically and
    philosophically sound, but also stalwartly supported by history.
