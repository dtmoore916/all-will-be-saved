<h1>
    The School of Caesarea
</h1>
<p>
    The school of Caesarea was founded by Origen and “soon outshone that of
    Alexandria, and labored for the spread of the kingdom of God” (Schaff
    1910). Considering the undeniable importance of universal restoration to
    Origen’s theological system, it is clear that this school also believed in
    and taught it. It is also clear its pupils were highly celebrated and
    influential in the church. On the influence of this school, the historian
    Eusebius (himself a bishop in Caesarea), tells us the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Whilst Origen was attending to his accustomed duties at Cesarea, many
    frequented his school, not only of the residents of the place, but also
    innumerable others from abroad, who left their country in order to attend
    his lectures. Of these the most noted whom we know is Thedorus, known also
    by the name of Gregory, and so celebrated among the bishops of our day;
    also his brother Athenodorus. Origen, seeing them excessively wrapt in the
    prosecution of the studies of the Greeks and Romans, infused into them the
    love of philosophy, and induced them to exchange their former zeal for the
    study of divine things. But after being with him five years, they made such
    improvement in the divine oracles, that both, though very young, were
honoured with the episcopate in the churches of Pontus. (<em>Ecclesiastical History, </em>Chapter XXX,<em> </em>p. 249 or p.145 in
    e-book pagination)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    From Eusebius’ testimony, it is apparent that the influence of the school
    was not confined to Caesarea but that “innumerable others from abroad” came
    to learn from it. In other words, it was highly respected and sought after
    for learning about the Christian faith. We also learn from this passage
    that this is the school from which came the highly esteemed Gregory
    Thaumaturgus and his brother Athenodorus.

<h2>
    Gregory Thaumaturgus, The Miracle-Worker
</h2>

    />
    
       <p class="caption">Saint Gregory the Miracle-Worker</p>
    
    </div>
<p>
    Gregory’s reputation in particular is one of such renown that it is
    worthwhile to spend some time on his person and views. His renown as a
    worker of miracles was well-known (Thaumaturgus is a title that means
    “wonder-worker” or “miracle-worker”) and he is venerated as a saint in
    several Christian traditions. Christianity Today, in a brief biography of
    Gregory’s life cites the renowned Basil the Great’s assessment of this
    church leader and saint:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Gregory was a great and conspicuous lamp, illuminating the church of God,"
    wrote Basil. "He possessed, from the co-operation of the Spirit, a
    formidable power against the demons, that he turned the course of rivers by
    giving them orders in the name of Christ; and that his predictions of the
    future made him the equal of other prophets."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		By both his friends and his enemies, Basil concludes, Gregory was regarded
    "as another Moses."
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Legends or no, Gregory's leadership must have been great, because during
    his ministry, most of the city of Pontus converted to Christianity.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Gregory was exceptionally effective at leading people to the Christian
    faith. One report shows just how effective he was, and what is meant by
    “most of the city” in the previous passage:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		From an ancient source we learn a fact that is at once a curious
    coincidence, and throws light on his missionary zeal; whereas he began with
    only seventeen Christians, at his death there remained but seventeen pagans
    in the whole town of Caesarea (Leclercq 1910).
	</blockquote>
<h2>
    Gregory Thaumaturgus’ Views
</h2>
<p>
    So, what were the views of this man of such an illustrious reputation among
    Christians for virtue, evangelism and even miracle-working, in regards to
    universal salvation? It is apparent that he held to the view that all would
    be saved, similar to his teacher Origen. To prove this, we will first look
    at some indirect evidence showing that he was a very devoted follower of
    Origen and then look at some direct evidence from his own works. First, on
    his admiration of Origen, Gregory says the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Now that greatest gift this man has received from God, and that noblest of
    all endowments he has had bestowed upon him from heaven, that he should be
    an interpreter of the oracles of God to men, and that he might understand
    the words of God, even as if God spoke them to him, and that he might
    recount them to men in such wise as that they may hear them with
    intelligence. Therefore to us there was no forbidden subject of speech; for
    there was no matter of knowledge hidden or inaccessible to us, but we had
    it in our power to learn every kind of discourse, both foreign and Greek,
    both spiritual and political, both divine and human; and we were permitted
    with all freedom to go round the whole circle of knowledge, and investigate
    it, and satisfy ourselves with all kinds of doctrines, and enjoy the sweets
    of intellect. And whether it was some ancient system of truth, or whether
    it was something one might otherwise name that was before us, we had in him
    an apparatus and a power at once admirable and full of the most beautiful
    views. And to speak in brief, he was truly a paradise to us after the
    similitude of the paradise of God, wherein we were not set indeed to till
    the soil beneath us, or to make ourselves gross with bodily nurture, but
    only to increase the acquisitions of mind with all gladness and enjoyment —
    planting, so to speak, some fair growths ourselves, or having them planted
    in us by the Author of all things. (<em>Oration and Panegyric Addressed to Origen,</em>
    Argument 15)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Gregory’s description of Origen as a teacher and interpreter of Scripture
    is one of the highest praise. It demonstrates an obvious respect and
    adoration that few teachers ever receive. As a science teacher myself, I
    cannot imagine a student ever feeling as if my class was “truly a paradise
    to us after the similitude of the paradise of God.” I have, however, had
    students ask how much longer it was before the bell would ring and free
    them from the apparent torture of boredom they were being subjected to more
    times than I can count. I am more familiar with “why do I have to learn
    this?” than students enjoying the “sweets of intellect.” At any rate, it is
    highly doubtful, based on this passage alone and Gregory’s close
    association with Origen, that he held views substantially different from
    him, especially regarding something that was so fundamental to his
    theological system, and it is certain that he did not consider his views
    heretical.
</p>
<p>
    We do not, however, have to rely on such conjecture. Gregory himself makes
it quite clear that he shares Origen’s views as to universal restoration (<em>apokatastasis </em>in Greek).
</p>
<p>
    In the same work cited above, for example Gregory says: “there lives still
    the <strong>Saviour of all men</strong>, even of the half-dead and the
    despoiled, the Protector and Physician <strong>for all</strong>, the Word,
    that sleepless Keeper <strong>of all</strong>” (<em>Oration and Panegyric Addressed to Origen
        ,</em>
    Argument 17). Here we see Gregory making the claim that Jesus is the
    Savior, Protector, Physician and Keeper of all men. Is he only speaking of
    Christians when he says “all men"? Clearly not, for he makes it clear that
    he means everyone, even those who are half-dead and those who are ruined,
    destroyed, and stripped of apparent worth (despoiled). It is worth
    dissecting the titles Gregory ascribes to Jesus, to avoid glossing over
    them. Otherwise, we might miss the deep meaning of what he is saying:
</p>
<p>
    1. As the Savior of all men, <em>he saves all men.</em>
</p>
<p>
    2. As the Protector of all men, <em>He protects all men.</em>
</p>
<p>
    3. As the Physician of all men, <em>He heals all men</em>.
</p>
<p>
    4. As the Keeper of all men, <em>He keeps all men.</em>
</p>
<p>
    In his work, <em>A Sectional Confession of the Faith</em>, Gregory makes
    many more statements that attest to his view that all will be saved
    eventually, even if they are currently outside of the true saving faith he
    professes. His primary purpose in this work is to defend the doctrine of
    the Trinity, and in so doing he expounds upon the role of the Son as
    follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		We believe, therefore, that it was without any change in the Divinity that
the incarnation of the Word took place with a view to the    <strong>renewal of humanity</strong>. For there took place neither mutation
    nor transposition, nor any circumscription in will, as regards the holy
    energy of God; but while that remained in itself the same, it also effected
the work of the incarnation with a view to the <strong>salvation</strong>    <strong> of the world</strong> … For the Lord of glory
    appeared in fashion as a man when He undertook the economy upon the earth;
    and He fulfilled the law for men by His deeds, and by His sufferings He did
away with man's sufferings, and by His death    <strong>He abolished death</strong>, and by his resurrection He brought
life to light; and now we look for His appearing from heaven in glory    <strong>for the life and judgment of all</strong>, when the resurrection of
    the dead shall take place, to the end that recompense may be made to all
    according to their desert. (<em>A Sectional Confession of the Faith,</em>
    Section 6)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    There are several important aspects of this passage that merit comment.
    First, it is clear that Gregory rightly perceived that the purpose of the
    incarnation of Jesus was to renew all of humanity and save the world. This
    concept is repeated several times throughout this work. For example,
    Gregory refers to the Church’s confession of Christ as “the Creed that
    brings salvation to the world” (Section 2) and speaks of the Trinity as
    having “power to sanctify the <em>whole creation</em>” (Section 18). These
    ideas are, of course, derived from the many scriptural verses that we have
    already discussed in detail that make the clear claims that Jesus is the
    Savior of the world and the Savior of all people, and that God was
    reconciling the world to Himself through the cross. There are too many to
    list here and they have been referenced many times already throughout this
    work.
</p>
<p>
    Gregory is also fond of discussing the fact that Christ abolished or
    destroyed death and mentions this several times. This is a clear allusion
    to 1 Corinthians 15:26-28 which states that “the last enemy to be destroyed
    is death … When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject
    to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.” The
    destruction of death in Scripture is tied intimately with the end result of
    God being all in all, which means that his righteousness, goodness, and
    love will so consume the entire being of every person that sin and evil
    will have no place. He will be everything to everyone.
</p>
<p>
    Gregory rightly understands that such an end does not preclude judgment,
    and acknowledges that Christ’s return will be “for the life and judgment of
    all.” It is important to note that Gregory is saying that all will
    experience both life and judgment and that all will receive recompense
    according to what they deserve. These concepts echo the Bible as well,
    which tells us that “as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made
    alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22) and that God will “reward each person
    according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve” (Jeremiah 32:10,
    17:10, 25:14, see also Revelation 2:23, 20:12-13, 22:12). There is no good
    reason to believe that Christians experience no judgment based on what they
    have done. Everyone is judged, but fortunately judgment is not synonymous
    with eternal agony in the flames of hell, as many would have you believe.
    There are consequences to our actions, but Gregory also acknowledges that
    the same who will experience judgment will also experience the life given
    freely to the world by Christ.
</p>
<p>
    We could continue to cite Gregory’s writings to show that he held to the
    hope that all will be saved, but it seems advisable at this point to wrap
    it up with one final passage that should remove all doubt as to his
    position on the matter:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The Son sojourned in the world, having of the Virgin received flesh, which
He filled with the Holy Spirit    <strong>for the sanctification of us all</strong>; and having given up the
    flesh to death, He destroyed death through the resurrection that had in
    view the <strong>resurrection of us all</strong>; and He ascended to
    heaven, exalting and glorifying men in Himself; and He comes the second
    time to bring us again eternal life.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		One is the Son, both before the incarnation and after the incarnation. The
    same (Son) is both man and God, both these together as though one; and the
    God the Word is not one person, and the man Jesus another person, but the
    same who subsisted as Son before was made one with flesh by Mary, so
    constituting Himself a perfect, and holy, and sinless man, and using that
    economical position
    <strong>
        for the renewal of mankind and the salvation of <u>all the world</u></strong>. (<em>A Sectional Confession of the Faith,</em> Section 18-19)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    The sanctification and resurrection of all people were, according to
    Gregory, Christ’s aims in coming to earth. He makes this as explicit as
    possible when he says that His perfect, holy and sinless life was used “for
    the renewal of <em>mankind</em> and the salvation of <em>all the world</em>
    .” It must be noted that “mankind” is a word that denotes all human beings
    corporately and includes every person. If you are a person, you are part of
    mankind and are therefore a member of the collective group that is being
    renewed through the work of Christ. It also must be pointed out that
    Gregory emphasizes the universality of salvation by saying that Christ is
    the salvation of <em>all the world</em>. It seems that Gregory felt it was
    not sufficient to simply state his purpose as the salvation of the world;
it was necessary to underscore its fullness by calling it the salvation of    <em>all</em> the world. This is reminiscent of 1 John 2:2 in which John
    tells us that Jesus is the atoning sacrifice for the “sins of the whole
    world.” It seems that both of these authors anticipated that people would
    wish to reduce the scope of salvation and thus misinterpret their words, so
    they made it undeniably clear that they were referring to the entire world
    and not just a part of it. 
</p>
	<p>
    Since it seems to me that all reasonable doubt
    has been removed as to Gregory’s doctrine of universal salvation of
    mankind, let’s know examine another eminent Church Father from Caesarea:
    Eusebius.
