    The School of Caesarea: Eusebius

       <p class="caption">Eusebius in a modern imagining </p>
    
    </div>
<p>
    Eusebius of Caesarea (aka Eusebius Pamphili) was bishop of Caesarea and as
    we have already discussed, is considered to be the father of church
history. On the importance of Eusebius’ history of the early church (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>), Francis Joseph Bacchus states that “it
    would be difficult to overestimate the obligation which posterity is under
    to Eusebius for this monumental work. Living during the period of
    transition, when the old order was changing and all connected with it was
    passing into oblivion, he came forward at the critical moment with his
    immense stores of learning and preserved priceless treasures of Christian
    antiquity” (Bacchus 1909). In short, much of what we know about early
    church history is due to Eusebius, without whom much would have surely been
    lost.
</p>
<p>
    It is clear that Eusebius, though not immune to controversy, was held in
    high esteem during his lifetime by many in the church, including emperor
Constantine. We are told that “at the opening of the    
	<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11049a.htm">Council of Nicæa</a>
    Eusebius occupied the first seat on the right of the emperor, and delivered
    the inaugural address … He evidently enjoyed great prestige…” (Bacchus
    1909). Certainly, one reason for this seat of honor was his reputation as
    “beyond question the most learned man and most famous living writer in the
    church at this time” ("Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature…”).
</p>
<h4>
    Eusebius’ Views
</h4>
<p>
    It is quite clear that this most learned man believed in universal
salvation and that he based his views on Scripture. In his work,    <em>On Ecclesiastical Theology</em>, Eusebius explains 1 Corinthians 15:28,
    saying that “if the subjection of the Son to the father means union with
    him, then the subjection of all to the Son means union with him” (as cited
    by Beecher) and proceeds to clarify his meaning as follows:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		As the apostle when he said all shall be subjected to the Son did not mean
    union of essence, but obedience flowing from free-will, together with the
    honor and glory which all give him as the Saviour, and King of all, in the
    same way his subjection to the Father means nothing else than the glory,
    and honor, and veneration, and exaltation, and voluntary subjection, which
    he is to give to God the Father, when he has made all worthy of his
    paternal Godhead. For, so long as they are not worthy of this, he,
    anticipating the future as a common Saviour of all, administers a kingdom
    restorative of the imperfect and curative of those who need healing.<a href="http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Retribution/retribution29.htm">
    (Beecher 1878, citing Eusebius' work, <em>On Ecclesiastical Theology</em>,
    Migne vi., p. 1030)</a>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Once again we see the clear understanding of subjection as being an act of
    willing obedience, not coercion. Subjection to Christ, the Saviour of all,
    is the ultimate destiny of every person. For Eusebius, the parallel nature
    of the subjection of all to Christ and the subjection of Christ to the
    Father are clear, as the very same word, in the very same sentence, is used
    to describe both: “When all things are <em>subjected</em> to him, then the
Son himself will also be <em>subjected</em> to him who put all things in    <em>subjection</em> under him, that God may be all in all” (1 Corinthians
    15:28).
</p>
<p>
    Beecher cites page 1031 of the same source to quote Eusebius, who repeats
    this concept yet again:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Christ is to subject all things to himself. We ought to conceive of this as
    such a salutary subjection as that by which the Son will be subjected to
    him, who subjects all to him. We ought to believe that he will effect a
    subjection ineffable, indescribable, and befitting him alone, when he shall
    present to God, even the Father, those subjected to himself, collecting
    them like a heavenly choir ascribing to him glory and honor and salvation
    and majesty, who is the source and cause of all good things.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is to be noted that the subjection is described as salutary 
	(beneficial). This does not mean that people who live wickedly waltz into 
	heaven without consequence. The unworthy must be restored and healed of the 
	disease of sin. Punishment is a therapeutic and purifying tool used in this 
	process of restoration.&nbsp; Describing the post-mortem punishment of a 
	thoroughly wicked and idolatrous hypothetical person who rejects Christ, 
	Eusebius says the following: "The judgment of God moreover, shall consign 
	him (thus) impure and unclean, as filthy and abominable to the <strong>
	purification</strong> and punishment which is <strong>by fire</strong>: 
	because he would not be instructed by THE WORD (or Reason), nor adhere to 
	the Divine law, when it was in his power to do so" (<em>Theophania</em>, 
	Book 1, Chapter 72).&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the many biblical references to fire 
	as purifying offer strong support for this assertion.&nbsp; Though the 
	wicked soul will be "miserable" according to Eusebius, his punishment by 
	fire will serve the purpose of purifying him. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>
    As in Clement and Origen, punishment was considered by Eusebius to be 
	analogous to the work of a physician.&nbsp; 
</p>
	<blockquote>
		On this account, just as Physicians prescribe their remedies to those who are sick and debilitated by pains and sufferings, not the healthy food proper for the robust, but things that give 
		<strong>uneasiness and pain</strong>; and, should it be necessary, do not excuse themselves from 
		<strong>applying cauteries and bitter draughts, to coerce the disease</strong>: not the aliments proper for the healthy, but those suitable to the sick: but, when they have become convalescent, they will henceforth allow them to partake of wholesome and strengthening food : So <strong>likewise the common Saviour of all, as the Shepherd and Physician of His rational flocks on earth, taught thos</strong>e who had previous to His last divine manifestation entered into the many follies of a plurality of Gods, and had been maddened by the evils and fierceness attending (this) corruption of mind, by bitter punishments, by pestilences, famines, and the continuance of wars against each other. 
		<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_theophania_03book2.htm">(<em>Theophania</em>, Book 2, Chapter 94-95)</a></blockquote>
	<p>
    In this passage, Eusebius is making reference to historical events that he 
	considers to be judgments against wickedness and idolatry.&nbsp; The purpose 
	of these judgments is clear for Eusebius.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are tools used by 
	the common Saviour of all to teach and heal those who have fallen into error 
	and wickedness.&nbsp; Though painful, the Great Physician applies 
	appropriate punishments in order get rid of the disease of evil.&nbsp; As 
	the Good Shepherd who searches until He finds the very last lost sheep, the 
	common Saviour of all pursues us and sharply corrects us as needed.&nbsp; The remedial aspect of
    punishment is clearly in view, as it was for very many of the early church
    fathers.
</p>
	<p>
    Now, some may object that the remedial punishments described by Eusebius 
	above do not apply to those being punished but rather only benefitted future 
	generations, since some of the punishments were fatal.&nbsp; For Eusebius, 
	however, the power of Christ to save was in no way hindered by death.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Now the laws of love summoned Him even as far as Death and the dead themselves, 
		<strong>so that He might summon the souls of those who were long time dead</strong>. And so because 
		<strong>He cared for the salvation of all for ages past, and that "He might bring to naught him that hath the power of death," as Scripture teaches</strong>, here again he underwent the dispensation in His mingled Natures: as Man, he left His Body to the usual burial, while as God He departed from it. For He cried with a loud cry, and said to the Father: "I commend my spirit," and departed from the body free, in no wise waiting for death, who was lagging as it were in fear to come to Him; nay, rather, He pursued him from behind and drove him on, trodden under His feet and fleeing, and 
		<strong>He burst the eternal gates of his dark realms, and made a road of return back again to life for the dead there bound with the bonds of death</strong>. Thus, too, His own body was raised up, and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose, and came together with Him into the holy and real City of Heaven, as rightly is said by the holy words: "Death has prevailed and swallowed men up"; and again: "<strong>The Lord God has taken away every tear from every face</strong>."
And <strong>the Saviour of the Universe, our Lord, the Christ of God, called Victor, is represented in the prophetic predictions as reviling death, and releasing the souls that are bound there, by whom He raises the hymn of victory, and He says these words:
 
"From the hand of Hades I will save them, and from death I will ransom their souls. O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?</strong> The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."
Such was the dispensation that brought Him even unto death, of which one that wishes to seek for the cause, can find not one reason but many. For firstly, the Word teaches by His death that 
		<strong>He is Lord both of dead and living</strong>; and secondly, that 
		<strong>He will wash away our sins</strong>, being slain, and becoming a curse for us; thirdly, that a victim of God and 
		<strong>a great sacrifice for the whole world</strong> might be offered to Almighty God; fourthly, that thus He might work out the destruction of the deceitful powers of the daemons by unspeakable words; and fifthly also, that shewing the hope of life with God after death to His friends and disciples not by words only by deeds as well, and affording ocular proof of His message, He might make them of good courage and more eager to preach both to Greeks and Barbarians the holy polity which He had established.
		<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_de_06_book4.htm">(<em>Demonstration of the Gospel</em>, 
		Book IV, Chapter 12)</a></blockquote>
		<p>It is quite clear that Eusebius believed in Jesus' complete 
		indisputable victory over death.&nbsp; As the great sacrifice for the 
		whole world and the Lord or both the dead and the living (1 John 2:2, 
		Romans 14:9), he is fully able to take away every tear from every face.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Death is not a barrier for the Saviour of the Universe.&nbsp; Instead he 
		ransoms the souls of all people from death, which He, through his 
		victorious death and resurrection, has rendered utterly powerless.&nbsp; 
		He makes this position clear elsewhere as well:</p>
	<blockquote>
		THIS clearly gives the <strong>good news</strong> of the Descent of God the Word from heaven, Who 
is named, and of the result of His Coming. For it says, "He sent his Word and 
healed them." <strong>And we say distinctly that the Word of God was He that was sent as 
the Saviour of all men</strong>, Whom we are taught by the Holy Scriptures to reckon 
divine. And it darkly suggests that He came down even unto death for the sake of those who had died before Him, and in revealing the redemption of those to be saved by Him it shews the reason of His Coming. For He saved without aid from any one those that had gone before Him 
		<strong>even to the gates of death, healed them and rescued them from their destruction. And this He did simply by breaking what are called the gates of death, and crushing the bars of 
		iron.</strong> 
		<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_de_08_book6.htm">(<em>Demonstration of the Gospel</em>, Book VI, Chapter 7)</a></blockquote>
	<p>The above is Eusebius' explanation of Psalm 107:10-22 which reads as 
	follows:</p>
	<blockquote>Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in 
		iron chains, because they rebelled against God’s commands
    and despised the plans of the Most High.
So he subjected them to bitter labor;
    they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.
He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness,
    and broke away their chains. Let them give thanks to the Lord for his 
		unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,&nbsp;for he breaks 
		down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.&nbsp; Some became 
		fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of 
		their iniquities.&nbsp; They loathed all food and drew near the gates of 
		death.&nbsp; Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved 
		them from their distress. He sent out his word and healed them; he 
		rescued them from the grave.&nbsp; Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love
    and his wonderful deeds for mankind. Let them sacrifice thank offerings
    and tell of his works with songs of joy. (NIV)</blockquote>
	<p>This ability of God to break the iron bars of death and save people from 
	the grave (even those who "became fools because of their rebellious ways" 
	and who seem forever lost in "utter darkness") is also attested to in the 
	New Testament, particularly in 1 Peter 3.</p>
	<h3>1 Peter 3:18-20 and 1 Peter 4:6 (NIV)</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.&nbsp; After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits— to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built 
		... For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.</blockquote>
	
	<p>These scriptural passages explicitly indicate that Jesus 
	preached the gospel to the wicked (even the evil people of Noah's day of 
	whom it is said that "every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time").&nbsp; 
	Surely these are the sort of people referrred to as those who "became fools 
	through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their 
	iniquities" and who dwelled in utter darkness as described in Psalm 107.&nbsp; 
	But even such apparently hopeless cases are not hopeless for the "Saviour of 
	all men," who is completely victorious over death and sin.&nbsp; Insead, 
	Jesus confronts death head-on to win back the souls of all people:</p>
		<blockquote>He escaped not from death; for this would have been pusillanimous, and it would have been thought that He was inferior to death. But, by this contention with Death as with a contemporary, He established the immortality of that which was mortal; and, this last conflict which 
		<strong>was for the salvation of all, secured (for all) the life which is immortal</strong>.
<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_theophania_04book3.htm">(<em>Theophania</em>, 
Book 3, Chapter 55)</a></blockquote>

	</div>
	<p>
    
    Yet again, Eusebius makes his position undeniable.&nbsp; The work of the 
	cross was for "the salvation of all" and it secured true life and 
	immortality for everyone.&nbsp; This universal salvation of all is a 
	pervasive theme.&nbsp; In <em>Theophania</em> alone, He uses the specific title "common Saviour of all" for Christ (and more rarely the Father) 22  times.&nbsp;  It is one of his favorite titles for Christ, second only to calling Him the "WORD OF GOD."&nbsp; 
	For Eusebius, this is who Christ is.&nbsp; He is the common Saviour of all 
	who cannot be hindered by anything in accomplishing his purpose of complete 
	reconciliation and unity of all people in Him.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
    
    The inclusiveness of the gospel is an undeniable and ubiquitous theme in 
	Eusebius' writings.&nbsp; Let's now look at a few more examples, providing 
	clear proof that Eusebius believed in the ultimate salvation of all people 
	through the work of Jesus.</p>
	<blockquote>
    He manifested Himself—and truly it was a divine and miraculous thing, such as never before or since is recorded to have happened—<strong>the Saviour and the Benefactor, too, of all</strong>. So, then, God the Word was called the Son of Man, and was named Jesus, because He made His approach to us 
<strong>to cure and to heal the souls of men. And therefore in Hebrew the name Jesus is interpreted Saviour</strong>. And He led the life which we lead, in no way forsaking the being that He had before, and ever in the Manhood retaining the Divinity. 
		<a href="http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0882/_P19.HTM">(<em>Demonstration 
		of the Gospel</em>, Book IV, chapter 10)</a>&nbsp;
	</blockquote>
	<p>As the Saviour and Benefactor of all, Jesus came to cure and heal the 
	souls of all men.&nbsp; It is unthinkable that He would fail in this 
	mission.&nbsp; In order to be the Saviour and Benefactor of all, He must, by 
	definition, save and benefit all.&nbsp; Otherwise, these titles could not 
	apply to Him.&nbsp; </p>

	<blockquote>
    And thus did these things shew, that the Providence (exerted) over 
		<strong>mankind</strong>, was from all time great, (and) evincing the care for 
		<strong>every man</strong>, which was both suitable and sufficient.&nbsp; Because then, great would be the change for the better 
		<strong>in every one</strong>, upon human life's becoming tranquillized, and the common conduct (<strong>of all</strong>) being changed from its former wildness to something approaching to benignity; it is likely, that the 
		<strong>common Saviour of all</strong>, the compassionate WORD OF GOD, 
		would more particularly, and the more readily, make his Divine 
		manifestation at a time that would be (most) suitable. He accordingly 
		came in by the mission of himself, and shewed forth to men, who could by 
		no other means arrive at the knowledge of the truth, by the 
		instrumentality of a human vessel, the God of truth. The God of truth 
		did then, through the divine operations and astonishing miracles which 
		were evident to all, shew forth the doctrine of heavenly teaching which 
		respected His Kingdom ; in order that by these, He might henceforth, 
		even as He had formerly afforded aid by means of the things already 
		mentioned,<strong> instruct the whole human race</strong> in the doctrine which is heavenly.
		<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_theophania_03book2.htm">
		(<em>Theophania</em>, Book II, Chapter 93-94)</a></blockquote>
		<p>Notice that Eusebius is describing the purpose of the Incarnation of 
		the common Saviour of all is to "instruct <em>the whole human race</em>."&nbsp; 
		This is because of His love and care for every person, for all mankind, 
		from all time.&nbsp; Ultimately the work of Jesus will change everyone 
		for the better, as He fulfills his mission as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>This suitable and sufficient care for every person comes from a heart of 
	love.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an "all-kind Father," God is not content to abandon His 
	children to endless misery.&nbsp; Instead, His goal as well as ours is "the 
	recurrence and restoration of our proper state. For the true end of man's 
	nature is not here on earth sinking down into ruin and destruction, but in 
	yonder place from which the first man fell away"
		<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_07_book7.htm">
		(Preparation for the Gospel, Book VII, Chapter XVIII) </a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Restoration to a right state with God is the end of all of mankind.&nbsp; We 
	will not be enslaved to sin and death forever for Jesus came to "to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind" (Luke 4:18).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	How could this not apply to those imprisoned by the chains of sin and death, 
	or those blinded by their ignorance of God's love?&nbsp; All must be 
	restored because of God's unfailing love for all.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>This is the fundamental reason for Christ's death and resurrection.&nbsp; 
	Describing Jesus' sacrifice as the Lamb of God and how it was foreshadowed 
	in the celebration of Passover of the Exodus, Eusebius states that He "was 
	going to suffer this <em>for the sake of the common salvation of all mankind</em>"  
	<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_on_easter.htm">(<em>On the Celebration of Easter; De sollemnitate Paschali)</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	<p>This salvation of all mankind is entirely dependent on God's grace and 
	Jesus' death and resurrection, and is entirely not of ourselves.&nbsp; 
	Eusebius (and the Bible) make it clear that we are powerless to save 
	ourselves; it is Jesus who saves all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	<blockquote>Why, then, are you surprised to learn the like about God (Whose 
		work is the sun, and the whole heaven, and the Cosmos)? That it is 
		impossible for any that exist to have fellowship in His unspeakable and 
		inexplicable Power and Essence save for One alone, Whom the Father 
		Himself in His Foreknowledge of the Universe established before all 
		things, so that the nature of begotten things might not altogether 
		through their own lack of energy and strength fall away, being severed 
		from the Father's unbegotten and incomprehensible Essence, but might endure and increase and be nourished, enjoying that mediated supply, which the Only-begotten Word of God 
		<strong>ceases not to provide to all, and passing everywhere and through all provides for the salvation of all equally</strong>, whether they have reason or not, whether they be mortal or immortal, of heaven or of earth, both divine and invisible powers, and, in a word, of 
		<strong>all things whatsoever that shared in being through His agency, and far more peculiarly still of those who possess reason and thought</strong>, 
		for which things' sake <strong>He does not at all despise the human race, but rather honours and cares for it, for the sake of the kinship and connection of their reason with Himself, inasmuch as it was said in the holy oracles that they were formed after His likeness</strong>.
		<a href="https://salvationforall.org/7_History/(Demonstration%20of%20the%20Gospel%20book%204,%20Chapter%206)">
		(<em>Demonstration of the Gospel</em>, Book 4, Chapter 6)</a></blockquote>
		<p>Jesus never stops providing salvation, but rather continues to 
		provide for the "salvation of all equally." He is working in everyone 
		and everything.&nbsp; As stated in Acts 17:28, "in Him we live and move and have our being" 
		for we "are his offspring."&nbsp; The universality of salvation and love 
		is explicit in this passage, applying to "<em>all things whatsoever</em> 
		that shared in being through His agency."&nbsp; In other words, <em>
		anyone</em> and <em>anything</em> created by God will be saved, but <em>
		especially</em> "those who possess reason and thought" (i.e. human 
		beings).&nbsp; The reason for this is God's love for us.&nbsp; He does 
		not despise the human race <em>at all </em>but "honours and cares for 
		it."&nbsp; We are His children, his kin, made in His image.&nbsp; His 
		unfailing love will not abandon His most valued creations to endless 
		misery and wickedness, but rather save us from ourselves.&nbsp; </p>

		<p>This salvation, for Eusebius clearly applies to all of humanity:</p>

	<blockquote>
    Now it was actually the case that the <strong>whole Humanity</strong> 
		was absorbed by the Divinity, and moreover the Word of God was God as He 
		had previously been man, and He deified <strong>humanity</strong> with 
		Himself, being the firstfruits of our
hope, since He thought actual <strong>manhood worthy of eternal life with Him</strong>, and of fellowship in the blessed Godhead, and
		<strong>afforded to us all equally</strong> this mighty proof of an immortality and kingdom with Him.

		<a href="http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0882/_P1D.HTM">(<em>Demonstration 
		of the Gospel</em>, Book IV, Chapter 14)</a>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This last passage undeniably confirms Eusebius' universal vision of 
	salvation for all human beings, but requires a bit more commentary for it is 
	easily misunderstood.&nbsp; Though strange-sounding to Western ears, the 
	doctrine of <em>theosis</em> or deification described above is very well-known in Eastern 
	Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.&nbsp; It is not pantheism or 
	polytheism, but rather the idea of full sanctification and participation in 
	God's kingdom.&nbsp; Consider this Orthodox description of <em>theosis</em>: </p>
	<blockquote>
		The human person does not merge with some sort of impersonal divine force, losing individual identity or consciousness. Intrinsic divinity is never ascribed to humankind or any part of the creation, and no created thing is confused with the being of God. Most certainly, humans are not accorded ontological equality with God, nor are they considered to merge or co-mingle with the being of God as He is in His essence.

		<br><br>In fact, to safeguard against any sort of misunderstanding of this kind, Orthodox theologians have been careful to distinguish between God’s essence and His energies. God is incomprehensible in His essence. But God, who is love, allows us to know Him through His divine energies, those actions whereby He reveals Himself to us in creation, providence, and redemption. It is through the divine energies, therefore, that we achieve union with God.

		<br><br>We become united with God by grace in the Person of Christ, who 
		is God come in the flesh. The means of becoming “like God” is through 
		perfection in holiness, the continuous process of acquiring the Holy 
		Spirit by grace through ascetic devotion. Some Protestants might refer 
		to this process as sanctification. Another term for it, perhaps more 
		familiar to Western Christians, would be mortification—putting sin to 
		death within ourselves. 
		<a href="http://ww1.antiochian.org/content/theosis-partaking-divine-nature">(Shuttleworth, "Theosis: Partaking of the Divine 
		Nature")</a></blockquote>
	<p>Regardless of how we feel about the semantics of calling this process 
	"deification," it is clear that such a goal of becoming more like God in 
	holiness and participation in His work should be a goal of every Christian.&nbsp; 
	Scripturally, this participation is the divine nature is well-described in 2 
	Peter 1:3-4:</p>
	<blockquote>
		His divine power has given us everything we need for a <strong>godly life</strong> through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them
		<strong>you may participate in the divine nature</strong>, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.</blockquote>
<p>It is indisputable that Eusebius saw this participation in the divine nature 
as the end of all of humanity, since he states that the "<em>whole Humanity</em> 
was absorbed by the Divinity" and that "He deified <em>humanity</em> with 
Himself."&nbsp; We will all be cleansed of our sin and freed from our slavery to 
evil desires, whether through participation in this process now or later.&nbsp; 
God's consuming fire will ultimately consume evil in all of us and make us like 
Him.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Eusebius' vision of a loving God who came to save all of humanity from 
	darkness and death is pervasive in his writings.&nbsp; As we continue to 
	examine the writings of the early church, will see that such a vision was 
	shared by very many, contrary to the brash claims of opponents.&nbsp; </p>
