<h1>
    The Alexandrian School
</h1>
<p>
    The school of Alexandria was one of the great catechetical schools of the
    early church, and was highly influential on Christian thought. Philip
    Schaff, who is widely known as one of the most important of church
    historians and who is considered to have “founded the discipline of
    American church history” (Graham), says the
    following about Alexandria:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great three hundred and twenty-two
    years before Christ, on the mouth of the Nile, within a few hours' sail
    from Asia and Europe, was the metropolis of Egypt, the flourishing seat of
    commerce, of Grecian and Jewish learning, and of the greatest library of
    the ancient world, and was destined to become one of the great centres of
    Christianity, the rival of Antioch and Rome. There the religious life of
    Palestine and the intellectual culture of Greece commingled and prepared
    the way for the first school of theology which aimed at a philosophic
    comprehension and vindication of the truths of revelation. Soon after the
    founding of the church which tradition traces to St. Mark, the Evangelist,
    there arose a "Catechetical school" under the supervision of the bishop. It
    was originally designed only for the practical purpose of preparing willing
    heathens and Jews of all classes for baptism. But in that home of the
    Philonic theology, of Gnostic heresy, and of Neo-Platonic philosophy, it
    soon very naturally assumed a learned character, and became, at the same
    time, a sort of theological seminary, which exercised a powerful influence
    on the education of many bishops and church teachers, and on the
    development of Christian science. It had at first but a single teacher,
    afterwards two or more, but without fixed salary, or special buildings. The
    more wealthy pupils paid for tuition, but the offer was often declined. The
    teachers gave their instructions in their dwellings, generally after the
    style of the ancient philosophers (Schaff 1910).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Schaff’s snapshot of Alexandria gives us a pretty good picture of the
    nature of the city, as well as of the character of the catechetical school that developed there 
	after being founded by the author of the gospel of Mark.&nbsp; Alexandria was a premiere cultural and intellectual center. As a modern
    analogy, it might be compared to the Boston area, home of Harvard, MIT and many
    other colleges and universities (several of them being quite prestigious).
    It was the place where deep thinking was done, and where the resources for
    scholarly learning were most available as home of the “greatest library of
    the ancient world.” Undoubtedly, the character of the city was a driving
    force in the catechetical school’s development as “the first school of
    theology which aimed at a philosophic comprehension and vindication of the
    truths of revelation.” To avoid these aims would be to ignore Peter’s
    exhortation in 1 Peter 3:15 to “always be prepared to give an answer to
    everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.” The
    Alexandrian school was therefore home to some of the most learned of all
    the Church Fathers, who were not only very knowledgeable of the Scriptures,
    but also highly adept at refuting the arguments of the Gnostics and pagan
    philosophers that they lived amongst.
</p>
<p>
    The Alexandrian school was highly respected by the early Church Fathers and
    “exercised a powerful influence on the education of many bishops and church
    teachers.” Because of this, it is important to examine what this school
    believed and taught if we are to have a right understanding of the views of
    the early church regarding God’s judgment. To do this, we will examine the
    lives and writings of the earliest of Church Fathers whose writings remain
    from that school. According to Schaff, “the first superintendent of this
    school known to us was PANTAENUS” but of his writings “nothing remains but
    some scanty fragments” (Schaff 1910). Since the writings of Pantaenus and
    any previous heads of the Alexandrian school have been lost, we will begin
    by analyzing the life and writings of his successor as head of the school,
    Clement of Alexandria.

    </div>
    <p>
    Clement of Alexandria lived from about 150 A.D. to about 215 A.D. It seems
    that little is known of his early life, but that he was born to pagan
    parents and later converted to Christianity. He was well-read and very
    familiar with Greek literature and religion and put this familiarity to use
    in defending the Christian faith and presenting it as the true source of
    knowledge to his contemporaries, rather than their own pagan and Gnostic
    philosophies. In fact, he used the term “Gnostic” rhetorically, saying that
    the true “Gnostic” (<em>gnosis</em> in the Greek simply means knowledge),
    is the Christian who is “holy and pious, and worships the true God in a
    manner worthy of Him” (<em>The Stromata, Chapter 1</em>). In such a manner,
    he turned the heretical Gnostic philosopher’s claim to secret knowledge on
    its head; the mystery of Christ and serving Him <em>is </em>the secret
    knowledge that is true and meaningful rather than the wild claims of the
    Gnostic heresies. Thus, he used his knowledge of pagan and pseudo-Christian
    culture to provide a basis for a defense of the Christian faith as
    reasonable and true.
</p>
<p>
Clement was highly respected in the early church. In    <em>De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men),</em> Jerome called him “the
    author of notable volumes, full of eloquence and learning, both in sacred
    Scripture and in secular literature.” In this same work, Alexander the
    bishop of Jerusalem is quoted, describing Clement as “the blessed presbyter
    Clement, a man illustrious and approved, whom you also know and with whom
    now you will become better acquainted a man who, when he had come hither by
    the special providence of God, strengthened and enlarged the church of
    God.” It is quite obvious that the reputation of Clement as “illustrious
    and approved” and one who “strengthened and enlarged the church of God”
    precludes the possibility that he was viewed as a heretic.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, his positive reputation continues to this day: he is still
    venerated as a saint in the
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_Church"
        title="Oriental Orthodox Church"
    >
        Oriental Orthodox Church</a>, the
    <a

        title="Eastern Catholic Churches"
    >
        Eastern Catholic Churches
    </a>
    and the
    <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Communion"
        title="Anglican Communion"
    >
        Anglican Communion</a>.&nbsp; According to <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia</em>, “down to the seventeenth
    century he was venerated as a saint. His name was to be found in the
    martyrologies, and his feast fell on the fourth of December” in the Roman
    Catholic tradition as well (Havey 1908). For Roman Catholics, his sainthood
    ended in the year 1586, approximately 1371 years after his death! So, for
    most of Christian history, Clement was considered a saint by most
    Christians. Nevertheless, sainthood or not, Clement’s writings demonstrate
    that he did not believe in eternal conscious torment, but rather in a God
    of love who punished for the purpose of correction. The facts that Clement
    natively spoke Greek and was able to read the original New Testament
    writings make his interpretations all the more significant. To these we now
    turn.
</p>
<h4>
    Clement’s Views
</h4>
<p>Certainly one of the most straightforward statements of his views on the scope of
    salvation can be found in his commentary on 1 John.<blockquote>
    "And not only for our sins,"— that is for those of the faithful,— is the Lord the propitiator, does he say, "but also for the whole world." He, indeed, saves all; but some [He saves], converting them by punishments; others, however, who follow voluntarily [He saves] with dignity of honour; "so that every knee should bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth;" 
		(Philippians 2:10) that is, angels, men, and souls that before His advent have departed from this temporal life. 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aquinasstudybible/home/1-john/clement-of-alexandria-on-1-john">(Clement, commenting on 1 John 2:2)</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is difficult to misunderstand what Clement is saying here.&nbsp; His 
	interpretation of 1 John 2:2 is straightforward and clear: Jesus "saves 
	all," not only the faithful but also the whole world, though the methods 
	used to convince different individuals varies.&nbsp; Some are saved by 
	learning through punishments and others are saved with dignity and honour, 
	but<em> all are undoubtedly saved</em>.&nbsp; Clement leaves no room for 
	doubt as to his meaning, but instead clarifies the connection of 1 John 2:2 
	and Philippians 2:10.&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the universal salvation 
	accomplished by Christ is that "every knee should bow to Him, of things in 
	heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth" as stated in 
	Philippians 2:10.&nbsp; And lest we misunderstand Clement's views as to what 
	is being referred to by "things in heaven, and things on earth, and things 
	under the earth," he explictly defines things in heaven as the angels, 
	things on earth as men, and things under the earth as "souls that before His 
	advent have departed from this temporal life."&nbsp; This leaves no doubt 
	that he is referring to all people that have ever existed (as well as 
	angels) worshipping the God who has saved them.&nbsp; Although this alone is 
	compelling enough evidence to ascertain Clement's position, we have much 
	more evidence that we can glean from his writings.</p>
	<p>Another clear, albeit more lengthy, exposition of his views can be found in Book VII of <em>The Stromata</em>, in chapter 2, which is
    entitled <em>The Son the Ruler and Saviour of All</em>:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Wherefore also all men are His; some through knowledge, and others not yet
    so; and some as friends, some as faithful servants, some as servants
    merely." 
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see Clement claiming that all men belong to Christ, but that some
    have not <em>yet</em> understood this reality or attained the same level of
    connection with Him. This, however, does not change that they belong to
    Him. Clement goes on to explain his reasoning for this assertion:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		For either the Lord does not care for all men; and this is the case either
    because He is unable (which is not to be thought, for it would be a proof
    of weakness), or because He is unwilling, which is not the attribute of a
    good being. And He who for our sakes assumed flesh capable of suffering, is
    far from being luxuriously indolent. Or He does care for all, which is
    befitting for Him who has become Lord of all. For He is Saviour; not [the
    Saviour] of some, and of others not. But in proportion to the adaptation
    possessed by each, He has dispensed His beneficence both to Greeks and
    Barbarians, even to those of them that were predestinated, and in due time
    called, the faithful and elect. Nor can He who called all equally, and
    assigned special honours to those who have believed in a specially
    excellent way, ever envy any. Nor can He who is the Lord of all, and serves
    above all the will of the good and almighty Father, ever be hindered by
    another.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this passage, we see that Clement viewed Christ as the Savior of all
    people precisely because he believed in the Biblical picture of God as both
    good and sovereign. To be unable to save would indicate weakness which is,
    of course, unbefitting the God of the universe. For Clement, it is readily
    apparent that God could not be hindered by anyone in His purposes. He also
    clearly perceives that being unwilling to save people was inconsistent with
    goodness, and impossible to reconcile with the God who is love.
</p>
<p>
    It is also clear from this passage that Clement viewed the predestination
    and election of some people not as an exclusive election to be saved, but
    rather as a special honor “to those who have believed in a specially
    excellent way.” In other words, Jesus is the Savior of all mankind, but
    some people are chosen to serve him faithfully in particular ways. Serving
    the Lord of all in this way is an honor and a privilege, not a reason to
    view ourselves as saved and others as damned for eternity.
</p>
<p>
    Clement continues:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		And it cannot be said that it is from ignorance that the Lord is not
    willing to save humanity, because He knows not how each one is to be cared
    for. For ignorance applies not to the God who, before the foundation of the
    world, was the counsellor of the Father. For He was the Wisdom in which the
    Sovereign God delighted. (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/pro008.htm#verse30" target="_blank">Proverbs 8:30</a>) For the Son is the power of God, as being the Father's most ancient Word
    before the production of all things, and His Wisdom. He is then properly
    called the Teacher of the beings formed by Him. Nor does He ever abandon
    care for men, by being drawn aside from pleasure, who, having assumed
    flesh, which by nature is susceptible of suffering, trained it to the
    condition of impassibility.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In this last paragraph, Clement shows that Christ, in addition to being
    neither unloving nor weak, is not too ignorant of the hearts of people to
    know how to save them. He knows precisely how to save each and every person
    and he never abandons anyone. Instead, He is God’s Word and Wisdom
    incarnate, who was able to conquer the flesh by becoming a man yet
    remaining sinless. This last concept brings to mind Hebrews 4:15, which
    states that “we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with
    our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as
    we are—yet he did not sin.” Therefore, in addition to His comprehensive
    knowledge of human beings as our Creator, He is also privy to understanding
    us <em>experientially, </em>since He <em>became</em> one of us. Clement
    rightly asserts that such a God could not possibly be unaware of how to
    reach each and every human being.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		And how is He Saviour and Lord, if not the Saviour and Lord of all? But He
    is the Saviour of those who have believed, because of their wishing to
    know; and the Lord of those who have not believed, till, being enabled to
    confess him, they obtain the peculiar and appropriate boon which comes by
    Him.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This statement clearly shows that Clement was not only referring to
    believers when he discussed “all men.” He is the Saviour of believers, but
    also unbelievers. It was clear to Clement that those who did not yet
    believe, inevitably would believe and confess Christ as Lord. It is
    apparent that Clement derived this understanding from Scripture, including
    the verses that clearly state that “every knee will bow, of those who are
    in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will
    confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”
    (Philippians 2:10-11, see also Romans 14:11, Isaiah 45:22-24). Colossians
    1, Ephesians 1, 2 Corinthians 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 are other Scriptural
    references to God’s ultimate purpose for unity, reconciliation and loving
    subjection of all through Christ, as we have already seen. Clement
    understood that God’s will “for all mankind to be saved and come to a full
    knowledge of the truth” as stated in 1 Timothy 2:4, would be accomplished
    by Christ:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Being, then, the Father's power, He easily prevails in what He wishes,
    leaving not even the minutest point of His administration unattended to.
    For otherwise the whole would not have been well executed by Him.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		But, as I think, characteristic of the highest power is the accurate
    scrutiny of all the parts, reaching even to the minutest, terminating in
    the first Administrator of the universe, who by the will of the Father
    directs the salvation of all…
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Jesus will succeed in saving everyone because of who God is, and God is
    truly sovereign. He cannot and will not fail in his purposes. To think that
    He will is absurd. Clement’s view of God’s sovereignty and will to save all
    people is also a critical aspect of His defense of God’s goodness. It seems
    that Clement anticipates that some will accuse God of wrongdoing if He is
    truly sovereign. In answer to this possible objection, he says:
    “He is in no respect whatever the cause of evil.
    For all things are arranged with a view to the salvation of the universe by
    the Lord of the universe, both generally and particularly.”
</p>
<p>
    Notice that it is precisely because of God’s ultimate purpose to save the
    universe that He is not to blame for evil. According to Clement, whatever
    evils result from our choices on this earth do not take away from God’s
    good plan in arranging the universe as it is. Ultimately, God’s purpose
    through all of it is to save everyone, regardless of our temporal choices.
</p>
<p>
    There is certainly enough evidence here to make an irrefutable case that
    Clement, who was highly respected in the early church, believed in
    universal salvation. Nevertheless, we will examine a few more of his
    statements that further support this case and offer other insights into his
    reasoning.
</p>
<p>
    For example, Clement stated that "the Lord preached the Gospel to those in
    Hades" and gave his reasoning for this assertion, referencing
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/bible/1pe003.htm#verse19" target="_blank">
        1 Peter 3:18-20</a>: “Do not [the Scriptures] show that the Lord preached the Gospel to those
    that perished in the flood, or rather had been chained, and to those kept
    in ward and guard?” (<em>The Stromata</em>, <em>Book VI, Chapter 6</em>). Thus,
    Clement’s native reading of the original Greek text of 1 Peter 3:18-20 led
    him to the same natural interpretation that I discussed earlier: Jesus
    preached the good news to the wicked who had previously died. The rationale
    for this preaching is further expounded by Clement:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		And, as I think, the Saviour also exerts His might because it is His work
    to save; which accordingly He also did by drawing to salvation those who
    became willing, by the preaching [of the Gospel], to believe in Him,
    wherever they were … since God's punishments are saving and disciplinary,
    leading to conversion, and choosing rather the repentance than the death of
    a sinner; and especially since souls, although darkened by passions, when
    released from their bodies, are able to perceive more clearly, because of
    their being no longer obstructed by the paltry flesh … There took place,
    then, a universal movement and translation through the economy of the
    Saviour.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Jesus’ role as Savior is why he continues to save, even beyond the grave,
    according to Clement. He “is the same yesterday and today and forever”
    (Hebrews 13:8) and for this reason his power and might to save is not
    restricted to our earthly lives. Instead Christ chooses repentance rather
    than death for the sinner, echoing Ezekiel 33:11: “As surely as I live,
    declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
    but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your
    evil ways! ...” The ability to turn from such evil ways was seen by Clement
    as especially plausible for those already dead since their fleshly desires
    were no longer factors that could prevent repentance. Instead of death
    resulting in permanent damnation, God’s punishments were viewed as saving
    and disciplinary, and as resulting in a universal movement of souls toward
    repentance and life in God.
</p>
<p>
    This concept of saving and disciplinary punishment was further explained by
    Clement on several occasions. For example, in The Stromata, Book VII,
    Chapter 16, Clement declares:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		For there are partial corrections, which are called chastisements
		(<em>kolasin</em>)<em>,</em> which
    many of us who have been in transgression incur, by falling away from the
    Lord's people. But as children are chastised (<em>kolazo</em>) by their teacher, or their
    father, so are we by Providence. But God does not punish (<em>timoreitai</em>), for punishment 
		(<em>timoria</em>) is
    retaliation for evil. He chastises (<em>kolazo</em>), however, for good to those who are
    chastised (<em>kolazo</em>), collectively and individually.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This passage makes it clear that Clement views the chastisements of God as 
	corrective rather than vindictive or vengeful.&nbsp; Some of the 
	significance of this passage is lost, however, without looking at the Greek, 
	so we will do that now.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words translated as "chastisements," 
	"chastises," and "chastised" are all forms of the Greek word <em>kolasin
	</em>(κόλασιν) or its verb form <em>kolazo</em> (κολάζω).&nbsp;&nbsp; You may recall that this is the same word that 
	Jesus used in Matthew 25:46 to describe the "punishment" of the goats in the 
	parable of the sheep and the goats.&nbsp; The fact that Clement uses this 
	word to specifically contradict the idea that God's judgment is vengeful 
	strongly substantiates our earlier claim that <em>kolasin
	</em>has the sense of corrective chastisement.&nbsp; This is highly 
	significant because Clement spoke Greek natively at a time near to the 
	writings of the gospels.&nbsp; It is therefore very likely that he 
	understood his native language correctly and knew that <em>kolasin</em> 
	meant correction.&nbsp; In fact, he seems to take it for granted that his 
	Greek-speaking audience understands this to be the plain meaning of the word 
	since he does not bother to define it.&nbsp; Instead he simply uses it as a 
	clear contrast to the word <em>timoria </em>(sometimes translated as 
	vengeance).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>
    &nbsp;Since Matthew 25:46 is one of the passages most 
	often cited to support the view of eternal punishment in hell, Clement's 
	testimony, (combined with a right understanding of the word <em>aiōnion</em> 
	as pertaining to another age, or age-long) strongly confirms that the 
	eternal punishment interpretation is erroneous.&nbsp; To the native 
	Greek-speaker,&nbsp; the consequence for the uncompassionate goats in 
	Matthew 25:46 would have been understood as "age-long corrective 
	chastisement" or "corrective chastisment of the age to come."</p>
	<div class="box">
		Clement uses forms of the Greek word <em>timoría</em> (τιμωρία) to describe 
		punishment done as vengeance.&nbsp; This word is only used once in the 
		New Testament (in Hebrews 10:29) to describe the punishment that a 
		Christian who deliberately continues sinning <em>after</em> receiving the knowledge of the truth,
		<em>deserves</em>.&nbsp; It is certainly possible that such a person
		<em>deserves</em> 
		vengeance, but whether they experience it or not is debatable.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>To see the above passage in the original Greek and English in 
		parallel, click
		<a href="https://archive.org/stream/clementalexandr01hortgoog#page/n300/mode/1up">
		here</a>.&nbsp; It is the 1902 translation cited at the bottom of this 
		page.&nbsp; Please note that I used <em>kolasin</em> (and <em>kolazo</em>)&nbsp; in the above quote 
		instead of the inflections of <em>kolasin</em> used in the text (for 
		simplicity and readability).&nbsp; The inflections are used in the 
		original Greek for grammar reasons but do not change the meaning of <em>
		kolasin (</em>or<em>
		kolazo)</em>.&nbsp; </div>
	<p>
    And in Book 1, Chapter 27, he describes how the corrections and punishments
    of the law aim at the good of men, likening correction and punishment to
    the practice of medicine:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Let no, one then, run down law, as if, on account of the penalty, it were
    not beautiful and good. For shall he who drives away bodily disease appear
    a benefactor; and shall not he who attempts to deliver the soul from
    iniquity, as much more appear a friend, as the soul is a more precious
    thing than the body? Besides, for the sake of bodily health we submit to
    incisions, and cauterizations, and medicinal draughts; and he who
    administers them is called saviour and healer, even though amputating
    parts, not from grudge or ill-will towards the patient, but as the
    principles of the art prescribe, so that the sound parts may not perish
    along with them, and no one accuses the physician's art of wickedness; and
    shall we not similarly submit, for the soul's sake, to either banishment,
    or punishment, or bonds, provided only from unrighteousness we shall attain
    to righteousness?
	</blockquote>
<p>
    It is impossible to deny that Clement viewed God’s judgments as remedial in
    light of all of this evidence. Like a skilled surgeon, God chastises “for
    good to those who are chastised, collectively and individually” and for the
    purpose of healing. This was undeniably Clement’s view and he held it as an
    essential aspect to faith in God:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		It is essential, certainly, that the providence which manages all, be both
    supreme and good. For it is the power of both that dispenses salvation— the
    one correcting by punishment, as supreme, the other showing kindness in the
exercise of beneficence, as a benefactor (<em>The Stromata, Book 1, Chapter 27</em>).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Prior to beginning my writing on the topic of salvation for all people I
    was unaware of Clement’s thoughts on the matter. It is quite remarkable
    then to see that we came to the same conclusion that it is a logical
    necessity that the scope of salvation must extend to all people due to
    God’s sovereignty and love. And we came to this same conclusion despite
    being separated by 1800 years of history and oppression of the concept.
</p>
<p>
    It is also quite significant and bears repeating that Clement spoke Greek
    natively and read the original Scriptures from the cultural mindset of
    their target audience. This does not <em>conclusively prove</em> that his
    interpretation was correct, but it should make you at least consider the
    possibility that some of our 21<sup>st</sup> century Western views might
    not be as well-informed as we’ve pretended them to be. Perhaps a native
    Greek-speaking individual from the early church might have some insight
    into the New Testament that frequently monolingual English-speaking
    Americans (and others) lack. This consideration alone makes his testimony a
    significant piece of evidence for the salvation of all.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, Clement’s eminence as an important, well-respected Christian
    in his day <em>does prove</em> that the church has not held the concept of
    universal salvation as consistently heretical, as Driscoll and others like
    to claim. Now, some may object that I’ve only discussed one early church
    father. You may be tempted to write him off as an unorthodox outlier, but
    you should not. Clement is not the only native Greek-speaking theologian of
    the early church to think this way. Not even close. We will see that
    Augustine was correct is stating that “<em>very</em> <em>many”</em> held
views like Clement’s, especially those who spoke Greek. Although we have    <em>very many</em> to discuss, in the interest of staying organized we will
    continue our study with Clement’s student and the subsequent head of the
    catechetical school of Alexandria: Origen.
