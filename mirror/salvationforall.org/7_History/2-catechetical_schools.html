<h1>
    The Catechetical Schools
</h1>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Catechetical school</strong>, in early Christianity, a type of educational institution with a
curriculum directed toward inquirers (especially those trained in the Greek    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/paideia">paideia</a><em>,</em> or
    educational system) whose aim was to gain a greater knowledge of
    Christianity and eventually, perhaps, baptism into the Christian community.
    Located in such centres as Alexandria, the catechetical schools became
    prototypes for later Christian institutions of higher learning.
	-
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/catechetical-school">Encyclopaedia Brittanica
    </a>
</blockquote
>
<p>
    In the early church, catechetical schools developed to educate people on
    the Christian faith and served not only an evangelistic purpose, but also
    trained church leaders and defended the faith against attacks from pagan
    philosophers, gnostic heresies, and the like. These theological schools
    were the places where church leaders were educated, similar to modern
    seminaries or universities. They also, as we just read, served as an
    inspiration and model for the development of these modern higher learning
    institutions. As such, they were the places where the most educated and
    influential Christians of the early church (often referred to as the Church
    Fathers), did much of their learning and work.
</p>
<p>
    Because of their importance to early church thought, it is essential to
    examine what these schools and their leaders thought about universal
    restoration as well as other views of judgment. According to Dr. Edward
Beecher’s scholarly work,    <em>History of Opinions on the Scriptural Doctrine of Retribution</em>, the
    following was the factual state of the early catechetical schools on this
    issue:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		It was, in brief, this: There were at least six theological schools in the
    Church at large. Of these six schools, one, and only one, was decidedly and
    earnestly in favor of the doctrine of future eternal punishment. One was in
    favor of the annihilation of the wicked. Two were in favor of the doctrine
    of universal restoration on the principles of Origen, and two in favor of
    universal restoration on the principles of Theodore of Mopsuestia. It is
    also true that the prominent defenders of the doctrine of universal
    restoration were decided believers in the divinity of Christ, in the
    Trinity, in the incarnation and atonement, and in the great Christian
    doctrine of regeneration; and were, in piety, devotion, Christian activity,
    and missionary enterprise, as well as in learning and intellectual power
    and attainments, inferior to none in the best ages of the Church, and were
    greatly superior to those by whom, in after-ages, they were condemned and
    anathematized (Beecher 1878, Chapter 22).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Beecher makes several key points in this paragraph. Of primary importance
    is the understanding that <em>most</em> of the catechetical schools of the
    early church favored universal restoration. This is in stark contrast to
    the audacious and inaccurate claim made by Mark Driscoll that the church
has consistently held this doctrine to be heretical. Instead, it was a    <em>majority</em> position of the early catechetical schools and was held
    to by very many of the early Church Fathers (as we will soon see by
    examining their own statements in primary source documents). According to
    Beecher, these defenders of universal restoration held orthodox views and
    had exemplary Christian character, knowledge, and zeal for God. As we will
    soon learn, many of these believers in universal restoration were pillars
    of orthodoxy who were instrumental in the development and perpetuation of
    biblical Christian doctrine.
</p>
<p>
    This being said, Beecher also makes it clear that there was diversity of
    opinion in the early church regarding this issue. One of the schools was
    annihilationist, believing that the wicked would be destroyed, and only one
    held to belief in eternal punishment. For those of you who like statistics,
    that means that over 83% of the early catechetical schools did <em>not</em>
    espouse the “traditional” doctrine of eternal conscious torment.
</p>
<p>
    So, what were these schools and where were they located? Beecher lists the
    following six schools:
</p>
<p>
    1. Alexandria (Universalist)
</p>
<p>
    2. Caesarea (Universalist)
</p>
<p>
    3. Antioch (Universalist)
</p>
<p>
    4. The Eastern Syrian great theological school alternating location between
    Edessa and Nisibis (Universalist)
</p>
<p>
    5. Asia Minor (Annihilationist)
</p>
<p>
    6. North Africa (Eternal Torment)
</p>
<p>
    Here is a map showing the locations of these schools (with the North
    African school represented by Hippo, where the most prominent defender of
    eternal conscious torment, Augustine, resided):

    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    Seeing the locations of the catechetical schools on a map for the first
    time was quite an enlightening experience for me. I wonder if it will have
    the same effect for you. Study the map for a bit. What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
    As for me, one of the first things that stood out was the distance of Hippo
    from the other prominent catechetical schools. Those who held to eternal
    torment were geographically far from other believers. To understand this
    distance more fully, I looked up directions from Alexandria to Hippo (since
    Alexandria is geographically closest by land). As it turns out, the
    distance from Alexandria to Hippo Regius (modern day Annaba, Algeria) via
    the International Coastal Rd/Route 40M is 2,774.0 km (approximately 1,724
    miles). This shows the travel route by road:
    <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHZL_enUS667US667&amp;ei=MZHcWtHTPI-28APgiozYBw&amp;q=distance+from+alexandria+to+hippo+regius&amp;oq=distance+from+alexandria+to+hippo+regius&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1l2.3425.4981.0.5278.9.9.0.0.0.0.150.896.7j2.9.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.741...33i21k1.0.LnS-m6vVV7Q"
    >
        link to route
    </a>
    . It is about as direct a route by land as one could imagine and is
    estimated to take about 35 hours with modern transportation methods. Now,
    imagine how long it would take with ancient transportation methods. Travel
    could have also taken place by sea, but again it is quite apparent from
    looking at the map that this too would have been quite a journey. The
    effect of this distance certainly would have limited the ability of
    theologians of the North African School to interact in fellowship and
    discussion with Christians of the other schools. Their theological views,
    therefore, developed in some measure in isolation from the rest of the
    Church body.
</p>
<p>
    But the North African school was not just <em>geographically </em>isolated,
    but also <em>linguistically</em> and <em>culturally</em> isolated. In terms
    of language, all the other schools natively spoke Greek, the language in
    which the New Testament was written. Because of this, they were able to
    interpret the biblical texts according to their natural original meanings,
    without needing translation. In contrast, the North African school had
    Latin as its native tongue. In general, its members therefore had to rely
    on translations, or less than perfect understandings of the foreign Greek
    language of the New Testament.
</p>
<p>
    Culturally, most of the schools approached the biblical texts with a Greek
    philosophical and metaphysical mindset, whereas the North African school
    interpreted the texts from a Roman legal perspective. According to Beecher,
    one of the most striking characteristics of the Latin-speaking North
    African school is “the fact that their theology was developed by them under
    the influence of the great system of Roman law, to which they had access in
    the Latin language" (Beecher 1878).
</p>
<p>
    Beecher continues to expand on this cultural difference, beginning with a
    reference to the work of Sir Henry James Sumner Maine, <em>Ancient Law</em>
    :
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Maine, in his history of ancient law, has not hesitated to say that the
    difference between Eastern and Western theology is accounted for by the
    fact that, in passing from the East to the West, theological speculation
    had passed from a region of Greek metaphysics to a climate of Roman law.
    The highest energies of the Roman mind had been employed in developing
    their wonderful system of law.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Hence in this school were laid the foundations of that Latin legal and
    anthropological theology which through Augustine gained such ascendency
    [sic] in Europe, and gave rise to Calvinism and the systems which have
    reacted from it. The fact that it was a legal school, and that it took a
    strong, deep hold of the question of human depravity and regeneration, gave
    it peculiar elements of power…
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		The metaphysical energies of the Greek mind developed themselves in the
    subtile [sic] questions raised by the doctrine of the Trinity and the
    person of Christ, and were so absorbed by these that they never entered
    into the great legal questions which were the staple of Western theology.
    In particular, they did not enter into any profound investigations as to
    law, penalty, atonement, pardon, and retribution. But, as we have seen,
    decidedly the most powerful minds adopted the doctrine of universal
    restoration, and those who did not adopt it entered into no controversy
    about it with those who did. In the African school all this was reversed.
    From the very beginning they took strong ground in favor of the doctrine of
    eternal punishment, as an essential part of a great system of law of which
    God was the centre (Beecher 1878, Chapter 28).

<p>
    Beecher and Maine’s thoughts on the cultural and theological differences of
    the Latin school versus the Greek schools seem quite accurate. Those of the
    Latin school of North Africa were influenced by the Roman legal system (and
    unfamiliarity with the Greek language of the New Testament) in their
    interpretations of scripture, whereas the Greek schools approached the text
    more philosophically (and with a clear understanding of Greek language and
    cultural nuances and symbols).
</p>
<p>
    In terms of Roman legal influence, it is no secret that the Roman system of
    law was harsh and unyielding. One need not look any further than
    crucifixion to demonstrate this fact. As a method of execution, it was
    specifically designed to be prolonged, shameful torture. It is rather
    curious that the school of North Africa would adopt the very mindset of
those who crucified their Lord by interpreting the good news as    <em>eternal</em>, shameful torture for most people. Nevertheless, this
    seems to have been the case.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast, in the Greek-speaking schools, “decidedly the most powerful
    minds adopted the doctrine of universal restoration, and those who did not
    adopt it entered into no controversy about it with those who did.” This statement is quite significant because it not only conveys the fact
    that the deepest Christian thinkers (who were also native-speakers of the
    biblical language) believed in the ultimate salvation of all people, but
    also shows that those who disagreed did not think of those Christians as
    heretical. Instead, we will soon see that they were highly influential and
    deeply respected. In fact, many of these powerful minds are still venerated
    as saints and/or doctors of the Church in Christian traditions that bestow
    such honors. So, who were these powerful minds?
</p>
<p>
    This is the question that we will next examine in great detail by examining
    the historical facts of their lives and by reading their actual words in
    primary source documents. As we do so, it will become quite apparent that
    those who wish to claim that universal salvation has been consistently held
    as heretical are basing this assertion on ignorance of historical facts.
    The evidence screams the opposite. To be clear, the views of very many of
    the early Church Fathers in favor of universal restoration do not prove
that it is true. Their views do prove, however, that it is not a    <em>new</em> idea. Rather, it would be more accurate to claim it as the
    dominant <em>original</em> idea of the early Church, derived from reading
    the New Testament in its original Greek. Their testimony is therefore
    critical for dispelling modern myths and rumors that such a view is
    heretical and has always been considered as such. It is also highly useful
    in informing our own interpretations of scripture by giving us insight into
    how it would have been understood by its original audience, the ancient
    Greeks. The Greek cultural and linguistic identity of these early church
    fathers is therefore invaluable to understanding how to interpret biblical
    texts from their perspective, rather than from our own, which is some
    twenty centuries removed from the culture and language of the New Testament
    writers.
</p>
<p>
    To this end, let’s now begin examining the lives and writings of some of
    the early church fathers from the catechetical schools we have described.
