<h1>
    The Historical Doctrine?
</h1>
<blockquote>
    That position [Universalism] has consistently been held as heretical by the
    Church for two-thousand years … You can go back to Athanasius, you can go
back to Augustine, you can go back to Huss, and Tyndale, and others. -<a href="https://vimeo.com/110259939."><strong>Mark Driscoll</strong></a>    <strong> (as cited by 
	<a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/unfundamentalistchristians/2017/04/indeed-many-universalism-early-church/">Distefano 2017</a>)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The above claim by Mark Driscoll seems representative of the common
    misconception of many modern pastors and churchgoers. While it may be true
    that<em> some</em> of<em> </em>the four people mentioned above did not view universal salvation
    favorably, it is certainly <em>not</em> true that the Church has held the
    position as heretical for two-thousand years.&nbsp; In fact, Athanasius 
	clearly and repeatedly <em>taught</em> universal reconciliation, so we know 
	at least 25% of Driscoll's claim is plainly untrue (see
	<a href="4b-alexandria-athanasius.html">here</a> for proof in Athanasius' 
	own words).&nbsp; It is not even clear that the other supposed
    ardent defenders of the hell doctrine mentioned above viewed universal
    salvation as heresy. Consider, for example, the words of one of the hell
    doctrine’s most staunch proponents, Augustine of Hippo:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		I must now, I see, enter the lists of amicable controversy with those
    tender-hearted Christians who decline to believe that any, or that all of
    those whom the infallibly just Judge may pronounce worthy of the punishment
    of hell, shall suffer eternally, and who suppose that they shall be
    delivered after a fixed term of punishment, longer or shorter according to
    the amount of each man's sin (The City of God, Book XXI, Chapter 17).
	</blockquote>
<p>
    In another translation of this passage, this amicable (friendly)
    controversy is translated as “a gentle disputation with certain tender
    hearts of our own religion” (Jukes 1878).&nbsp; This quite plainly tells us that
    Augustine did not view universal salvation as heresy but rather as a view
    held by other Christians. The disagreement on the subject was gentle and
    friendly, rather than contentious. Augustine himself admits that the number
    of believers who disagreed with him on this subject were “indeed very many”
(<em>Enchiridion</em>, also known as    <em>The Handbook on Faith, Hope, and Love</em>, Chapter 112). Therefore, by
    the testimony of Augustine, <em>very many</em> <em>Christians</em> (whom he
    regarded as such, and not as heretics), disagreed with him on the
    eternality of punishment. This disagreement was not, in any respect,
    grounds for breaking fellowship or maligning anyone as a false teacher.
</p>
<p>
    We will shortly see that the primary reason why Augustine was incorrect in
    his exegesis was because he lacked sufficient understanding of Greek, the
    language in which the New Testament was composed. The “very many,” as it
    turns out, were actually correct in disagreeing with Augustine, and based
    their view on a deeper understanding of Greek language and culture that
    Augustine lacked. But this is a subject that we will examine in much more
    detail later. For now, it is simply necessary to point out that the church
    of Augustine’s time (and Augustine himself) did not view eternal punishment
    as indisputable dogma, nor did it view ultimate restoration as damnable
    heresy. Those errors arose later in history.
</p>
<p>
    We will soon see that Driscoll’s claim that universal salvation has
    “consistently been held as heretical by the Church for two-thousand years”
    is indeed an enormous error that demonstrates little knowledge of church
    history. Such erroneous assertions seem to be made quite frequently. In the
    following pages, we will spend a great deal of time looking at actual
    textual evidence (including many primary sources written by highly
    respected Church Fathers and theologians) that undeniably refute these
    sorts of assertions. The church has held several different opinions on the
    matter throughout history, including universal reconciliation (especially
    in the early Greek-speaking church), as we shall soon see. So, buckle up
    and put on your thinking caps. Our tour through history is about to begin.
