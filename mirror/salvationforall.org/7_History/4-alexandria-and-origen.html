    The School of Alexandria: Origen

<p>
    Clement’s pupil and successor of the school of Alexandria was Origen (c.
    184 – c. 253) who is considered to be “the most important theologian and
    biblical scholar of the early Greek church” (Chadwick, 2017). Nevertheless,
    perhaps upon hearing the name Origen, you are tempted to dismiss all of his
    thoughts as unorthodox. I know that I had <em>heard</em>, prior to my
    research, that Origen was a heretic and I therefore did not read any of his
    work or learn anything about his life. I had simply accepted the hearsay
    uncritically. Someone (I don’t even recall who it was or in what context it
    occurred), had told me that Origen and his view of universal restoration
    were heretical, and this association prevented me from investigating
    further. Fear of being misled, it seems, is the tool that is used to
    prevent well-meaning Christians from engaging their brains in honest
    research. Nevertheless, at a critical point in my faith, I recalled that I
    had heard of this “heretic” named Origen who believed that all would
    eventually be saved. I wondered how he came to this conclusion and if it
    really was unscriptural, so I Googled him. Interestingly, in that first
    search I did not actually end up investigating Origen at all but rather
    ended up on a different website that presented many scriptural reasons for
    the salvation of all people. I decided that I needed to do my due
    diligence, like the Bereans in Acts, to see if what the author was saying
    was actually true and biblical. It was, and that is why I’ve been spending
    countless hours investigating and many mornings reading and writing before
    going to work. The good news really compels you to want to share it.
</p>
<p>
    But enough of my story. Was Origen actually a heretic? If not, how was he
    branded as one?
</p>
<p>
    As a matter of first importance, it must be noted that Origen was not
    viewed as a heretic during his lifetime (or in the proximal centuries that
    followed), but rather was highly respected and had tremendous influence.
</p>
<p>
    Jerome (347-420 AD), who is considered one of the four “Great Church
    Fathers” of the Western Church says the following about Origen:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Who is there, who does not also know that he was so assiduous in the study
    of Holy Scriptures, that contrary to the spirit of his time, and of his
    people, he learned the Hebrew language, and taking the Septuagint
    translation, he gathered the other translations also in a single work … And
    besides these, a fifth, sixth, and seventh translation, which we also have
    from his library, he sought out with great diligence, and compared with
    other editions. And since I have given a list of his works, … I pass this
    by now, not failing however, to make mention of his immortal genius, how
    that he understood dialectics, as well as geometry, arithmetic, music,
    grammar, and rhetoric, and taught all the schools of philosophers, in such
    wise that he had also diligent students in secular literature, and lectured
    to them daily, and the crowds which flocked to him were marvelous. These,
    he received in the hope that through the instrumentality of this secular
literature, he might establish them in the faith of Christ. (<em>De Viris Illustribus)</em>
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Jerome makes it quite clear that he and many others held Origen in high
    esteem. This is, in fact, taken for granted and is why Jerome asks
    rhetorically “Who is there, who does not know…?” of Origen’s impressive
    accomplishments and knowledge of Scripture. One major accomplishment to
    which Jerome refers is the <em>Hexapla</em>, a comparison of various
    translations of the entire Old Testament side by side. This required Origen
    to learn Hebrew, with the intent of comparing the various translations to
    the original Hebrew text. Obviously, this had to be done <em>by hand</em>
    and required incredible learning and diligence in Scripture study.
    According to the
    <em>
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hexapla">
            Encyclopaedia Britannica
        </a>
    </em>
    , “the entire work took 20 years to complete and may have filled 7,000
    pages.”
</p>
<p>
    His knowledge in all areas impressed his own generation and future
    generations so much that Jerome praises his “immortal genius.” Jerome also
    makes it clear that he used this genius to spread and defend the Christian
    faith. This assessment is corroborated by modern scholarship. According to
    John Anthony McGuckin, Origen’s primary aim in his study of so many areas
    of knowledge, including Greek philosophy, was to enable him to better
    defend and explain the Christian faith:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The tradition of the faith was something Origen set himself to maintain
    and defend. For him, that meant not only a complete christocentric, or
    soteriological, focus in all his thought patterns, but more precisely, that
    the plan of cosmic meaning was given to the inspired commentator primarily
    in the text and subtext of the sacred books…The exegesis of the Scriptures
    was all-important for him and made Origen’s whole eclectic philosophical
    stand, however much it might be indebted to the Hellenists, entirely and
    unarguably a Christian and biblicist enterprise. (2004)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    To paraphrase McGuckin’s statements:
</p>
<p>
    1. Origen was determined to maintain and defend the Christian faith.
</p>
<p>
    2. Because of this, he focused on the person of Christ and his role as
    Savior (which reminds me of the apostle Paul who said in 1 Corinthians 2:2
    “For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ
    and him crucified.”)
</p>
<p>
    3. Origen obtained his understandings from the Scriptures.
</p>
<p>
    4. Origen’s views, though influenced by Greek culture to an extent, were
    “entirely and unarguably” Christian, and based on the Biblical texts.
</p>
<p>
    Returning closer to the time of Origen’s life, we find further praise and
    evidence that he was viewed with the highest respect. Eusebius of Caesarea,
    who lived from approximately 260 to 340 AD, is widely known as the father
    of church history since his ten-book work <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>
    is the first known work on the subject. In this very work, Eusebius devotes
    a large portion of Book VI to Origen, with almost all of his writing being
    laudatory. It is clear that Eusebius highly esteemed the man, and that he
    was far from being alone in his deep admiration.
</p>
<p>
    He tells of Origen’s Christian upbringing and unwavering dedication to the
    faith from a very young age, describing his zeal for God in no uncertain
    terms. Living during a time of severe persecution, Origen experienced the
    martyrdom of his father before the age of 17 and would have possibly been
    martyred himself at this time if his mother had not hidden his clothes to
    prevent him from leaving the house.&nbsp; After
    this, while teaching at the catechetical school, “the persecution burned
    against him, so that the whole city could no longer contain him; but he
    removed from house to house and was driven in every direction because of
    the multitude who attended upon the divine instruction which he gave. For
    his life also exhibited right and admirable conduct according to the
    practice of genuine philosophy. For they say that his manner of life was as
    his doctrine, and his doctrine as his life. Therefore, by the divine Power
working with him he aroused a great many to his own zeal” (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, Book VI, chapters 2 and 3).
</p>
<p>
    Eusebius further describes how the church of Origen’s time viewed him in
    Chapter 8 of <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, confirming once again that he
    was greatly esteemed: “The bishops of Cesarea and Jerusalem, who were
    especially notable and distinguished among the bishops of Palestine,
    considering Origen worthy in the highest degree of the honor, ordained him
    a presbyter. Thereupon his fame increased greatly, and his name became
    renowned everywhere, and he obtained no small reputation for virtue and
    wisdom.”
</p>
<p>
    Eusebius also gives us insight into how Origen’s name began to be
    tarnished. He tells, for example, of a man who wrote against the church and
    who sought to disparage the Scriptures named Porphyry. This man “being
    unable in any way to find a base accusation against the doctrines, for lack
    of arguments turns to reviling and calumniating their interpreters,
    attempting especially to slander Origen, whom he says he knew in his youth.
    But truly, without knowing it, he commends the man; telling the truth about
    him in some cases where he could not do otherwise; but uttering falsehoods
    where he thinks he will not be detected” (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>,
    Book VI, chapter 19). Thus, Eusebius makes it clear that there were those
    who were willing to slander Origen’s name dishonestly in order to attack
    the church, even in those early days. Eusebius implies that the motivation
    for denigrating Origen sometimes was simply jealousy. He describes
    Demetrius as an example of this. As bishop of Alexandria he initially
    commended Origen but after “seeing that he was prospering, and becoming
great and distinguished among all    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>” 
	he was “overcome by human weakness” and “accused him bitterly” (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm"><em>Ecclesiastical History
        </em></a>
    
    , Book VI, chapter 8).
</p>
<p>
    In spite of these attempts at defamation, we see that Origen was certainly
    one of the most, if not the most, respected Christian teachers of his time.
    In his <em>Panegyric on Origen</em>, Saint Gregory Thaumaturgus says the
    following of listening to Origen teach:
</p>

		For he did not aim merely at getting round us by any kind of reasoning; but
    his desire was, with a benignant, and affectionate, and most benevolent
    mind, to save us, and make us partakers in the blessings that flow from
    philosophy, and most especially also in those other gifts which the Deity
    has bestowed on him above most men, or, as we may perhaps say, above all
    men of our own time. I mean the power that teaches us piety, the word of
    salvation … And thus, like some spark lighting upon our inmost soul, love
    was kindled and burst into flame within us — a love at once to the Holy
    Word, the most lovely object of all, who attracts all irresistibly toward
    Himself by His unutterable beauty, and to this man, His friend and
    advocate. And being most mightily smitten by this love, I was persuaded to
    give up all those objects or pursuits which seem to us befitting, and among
    others even my boasted jurisprudence — yea, my very fatherland and friends,
    both those who were present with me then, and those from whom I had parted.
    And in my estimation there arose but one object dear and worth desire — to
    wit, philosophy, and that master of philosophy, this inspired man. (<em><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0604.htm">Oration and Panegyric Addressed to Origen

<p>
    This is exceptionally rare and high praise from a student about his
    teacher. Gregory makes it clear that Origen’s aim in teaching philosophy
    and all other forms of knowledge was to lead his students to Christ and His
    salvation. His success is described poetically as a fire of love for Christ
    (whom Gregory describes as the Holy Word) that “burst into flame” within
    his pupils. For Gregory this flame inspired him to give up all else in the
    pursuit of knowing and understanding God, of loving Him with all his mind
    through study. Gregory loved, as 1 John 4:19 says, because God “first loved
    us,” and he was inspired to understand this love and the “unutterable
    beauty” of the Savior through Origen’s thoughtful exposition of Scripture
    and through his character. As he describes elsewhere in this same work,
    Origen not only preached the good news, but lived his life as a
    demonstration of it.

		Gregory Thaumaturgus was also known as Theodore. It is thought
    that he took the name Gregory at his baptism. Also, Thaumaturgus means
    “wonder worker” (or “miracle worker” (McGuckin 2004). It is a title rather
    than a last name.
</div>
<p>
    Centuries later, Origen’s character was still revered as an example of
    Christian virtue, even by those who disagreed with aspects of his theology.
    Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (1694-1755 AD), was a German Lutheran theologian
    and church historian “who founded the pragmatic school of church
    historians, which insisted on objective, critical treatment of original
    sources” (<em><a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Lorenz-von-Mosheim"
        >Encyclopaedia Brittanica
        </a>
    </em>
    ). Mosheim says the following of Origen:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Origen possessed every excellence that can adorn the Christian character;
    uncommon piety, from his very childhood; astonishing devotedness to that
    most holy religion which he professed; unequalled perseverance in labors
    and toils for the advancement of the Christian cause; untiring zeal for the
    church, and for the extension of Christianity; an elevation of soul which
    placed him above all ordinary desires or fears; a most permanent contempt
    of wealth, honors, pleasures, and of death itself; the purest trust in the
    Lord Jesus, for whose sake, when he was old and oppressed with ills of
    every kind, he patiently and perseveringly endured the severest sufferings.
    It is not strange, therefore, that he was held in so high estimation, both
    while he lived and after death. Certainly if any man deserves to stand
    first in the catalogue of saints and martyrs, and to be annually held up as
    an example to Christians, this is the man: for, except the apostles of
    Jesus Christ and their companions, I know of no one, among all those
    enrolled and honored as saints, who excelled him in holiness and virtue.
    (Mosheim 1868)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Mosheim’s praise is not an unusual assessment of Origen’s character,
    reputation, and influence. Instead, such an understanding is ubiquitous
    amongst informed church historians. Consider the following from George
Sarris, in which he cites volume 23 of the massive scholarly work    <em>Ante-Nicene Christian Library</em>:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The editors of the classic, multi-volume set of the writings of the Early
    Church fathers from AD 100-325 said of Origen, “The character of Origen is
    singularly pure and noble; for his moral qualities are as remarkable as his
    intellectual gifts. The history of the church records the names of few
    whose patience and meekness under unmerited suffering were more conspicuous
    than his. “. . . To him belongs the rare honor of convincing heretics of
    their errors, and of leading them back to the church – a result that must
    have been due as much to the gentleness and earnestness of his Christian
    character, as to the prodigious learning, marvelous acuteness, and logical
    power, which entitle him to be regarded as the greatest of the Fathers.”
    (Sarris, pp. 49-50, citing

	</blockquote>
<p>
    The famous church historian Philip Schaff gives a similarly adulatory
    description:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Origen was the greatest scholar of his age, and the most gifted, most
    industrious, and most cultivated of all the ante-Nicene fathers. Even
    heathens and heretics admired or feared his brilliant talent and vast
    learning. His knowledge embraced all departments of the philology,
    philosophy, and theology of his day. With this he united profound and
    fertile thought, keen penetration, and glowing imagination. As a true
    divine, he consecrated all his studies by prayer, and turned them,
    according to his best convictions, to the service of truth and piety. 
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		…He was a guide from the heathen philosophy and the heretical Gnosis to the
    Christian faith. He exerted an immeasurable influence in stimulating the
    development of the catholic theology and forming the great Nicene fathers,
    Athanasius, Basil, the two Gregories, Hilary, and Ambrose, who
    consequently, in spite of all his deviations, set great value on his
    	services. (<a href="http://www.bible.ca/history/philip-schaff/2_ch13.htm.)">Schaff 1910
    </a>
    )
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Schaff continues later in this same work to express his admiration for
    Origen and his endurance of persecution for Christ:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		It is impossible to deny a respectful sympathy, veneration and gratitude to
    this extraordinary man, who, with all his brilliant talents and a best
    [sic] of enthusiastic friends and admirers, was driven from his country,
    stripped of his sacred office, excommunicated from a part of the church,
    then thrown into a dungeon, loaded with chains, racked by torture, doomed
    to drag his aged frame and dislocated limbs in pain and poverty, and long
    after his death to have his memory branded, his name anathematized, and his
    salvation denied; but who nevertheless did more than all his enemies
    combined to advance the cause of sacred learning, to refute and convert
    heathens and heretics, and to make the church respected in the eyes of the
    world. (<a href="http://www.bible.ca/history/philip-schaff/2_ch13.htm.)">Schaff 1910

	</blockquote>
<p>
    Let’s now recap some of the main ideas about Origen, as described by the
    various historians, theologians, and saints quoted thus far:
</p>
<p>
    1. Origen’s Christian character, even under unjust persecution and torture,
    was impeccable.
</p>
<p>
    2. Origen’s influence on Christian thought and Christian leaders was
    tremendous.
</p>
<p>
    3. Origen advanced the cause of Christ more than anyone else (and
    especially more than his enemies according to Schaff) in his time by a
    large margin.
</p>
<p>
    4. Origen was successful at convincing heretics of their errors and leading
    them back to faith in Christ.
</p>
<p>
    5. Origen was an extraordinarily intelligent, diligent student of scripture
    and a phenomenal teacher and evangelist.
</p>
<p>
    I will leave it to you to evaluate whether condemning him as a heretic
    without reading any of his work is justified. But before you make your
    decision on this matter, let’s consider briefly how he came to be regarded
    as a false teacher in the first place. We will spend more time on these
    circumstances later, but for now let’s consider the words of Beecher on the
    subject:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		Two great facts stand out on the page of ecclesiastical history: One, that
    the first system of Christian theology was composed and issued by Origen in
    the year 230 after Christ, of which a fundamental and essential element was
    the doctrine of the universal restoration of all fallen beings to their
    original holiness, and union with God.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		The second is, that, after the lapse of a little more than three centuries,
    in the year 544, this doctrine was for the first time condemned and
    anathematized as heretical. This was done, not in a general council, but in
    a local council called by the Patriarch Mennas at Constantinople, by the
    order of Justinian.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		During all this long interval, the opinions of Origen and his various
    writings were an element of power in the whole Christian world. For a long
    time he stood high as the greatest luminary of the Christian world. He gave
    an impulse to the leading spirits of subsequent ages, and was honored by
    them as their greatest benefactor. At last, after all his pupils were dead,
    in the remote age of Justinian he was anathematized as a heretic of the
    worst kind. The same also was done with respect to Theodore of Mopsuestia,
    of the Antiochian school, who held the doctrine of universal restitution on
    a different basis. This, too, was done long after he was dead, in the year
    553. From and after this point the doctrine of future eternal punishment
    reigned with undisputed sway during the Middle Ages that preceded the
    Reformation. (
    <a href="http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Retribution/retribution21.htm">
        Beecher 1878
    </a>
    )
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This is a rather cogent summary of the condemnation of Origen by a future
    generation, in spite of his extraordinary contributions to Christian
    thought. It was done primarily as a result of imperial decree by Justinian
    rather than by the church leadership itself. In addition, much of what was
    anathematized about Origen’s teachings was not actually his:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		As a firm supporter of endless punishment, Justinian pushed hard for the
    Church to issue a series of judgments against what he called Origenist
    teachings about restoration. But the judgments weren’t actually against
    what Origen wrote and supported. They were against a “radicalized . . .
    doctrine of [restoration] that went far beyond the hopes of Origen or
    Gregory of Nyssa.” (Sarris p. 47, citing Daley p. 190)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    This seems to be one of the key misunderstandings of those who are
    uninformed about Origen. Much of what was deemed heretical was not what he
    actually taught or wrote. Even today people spread rumors about Origen’s
    teachings, suggesting, for example, that he taught reincarnation, which he
    did not. Since I do not want to deviate too much from the purpose of this
    writing, I will not go into detail explaining how this rumor started or why
    it is false. If, however, you are interested in researching this further,
    here are some sites that do a pretty good job setting things straight:
    <a href="https://www.catholic.com/tract/reincarnation">
        site 1  
    </a> 
    &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.john-uebersax.com/plato/origen1.htm">site 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, I think an analogy would be helpful to understanding the
    circumstances surrounding Origen’s fall from favor. Imagine a highly
    respected Church leader of our day, perhaps Billy Graham. Now imagine that
    in about 300 years from now, the president of the United States decides
    that he does not like Billy Graham. Picture further, that there are a bunch
    of people claiming to follow Billy Graham’s teachings but that they are
    saying a bunch of things that he never taught. Now, imagine that in this
    dystopian future the president has unquestioned dictatorial power, and that
    he forces church leaders to curse the name of Billy Graham and call him a
    heretic. To refuse would lead to banishment and loss of position. Since
    many of the church leaders do not really want to curse Billy Graham, they
    decide to anathematize some of the doctrines claimed by his “followers”
    without attaching Billy Graham’s name to the document. The president then
    burns Graham’s works and centuries later churchgoers assume that Billy
    Graham was a false teacher and a heretic of the worst sort, and avoid
    investigating him at all, with the threat of unending punishment looming
    over them as a threat so they won’t get too curious and find out what he
    really said.
</p>
<p>
    That scenario is basically what happened to Origen.
</p>
<p>
    The point of all of this is not to claim that everything that Origen wrote
    was accurate and true. I would not claim this for any theologian. Since
    Origen was incredibly prolific (estimates of the number of his works range
    from 2,000 to 6,000), it is inevitable that he made some speculative errors
    that went beyond the biblical text. Origen himself is aware that he
    speculates and makes it clear that he is doing so, saying that “these
    subjects, indeed, are treated by us with great solicitude and caution, in
    the manner rather of an investigation and discussion, than in that of fixed
    and certain decision…on the present occasion our exercise is to be
    conducted, as we best may, in the style of a disputation rather than of
    strict definition” (<em>De Principiis</em>, Book I, Chapter 6).
    Nevertheless, these speculations were the efforts of a diligent, committed
    mind intent on understanding and sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with
    people in a way that was persuasive and understandable within their
    cultural context. They were certainly not the speculations of a heretic
    intent on harming the church; instead they were attempts to make faith
    understandable to his audience. Indeed, one of the most prevalent
    criticisms of Origen is that he utilized Plato’s ideas excessively. But how
    could he reach the Greek mind without understanding and utilizing the type
    of philosophy that dominated it? Besides, most Christians still cherish
    Platonic concepts, like the innate immortality of the soul, that are not
    really found in the Bible. Should we anathematize all of these Christians
    as well? What about all of those who speculate on the nature of heaven, or
    hell, or the love of God, and in making an effort to understand the Bible
    better, go beyond it? It seems all pastors, teachers, and theologians would
    have to be declared heretics, unless they avoid exposition altogether and
    simply read the biblical text verbatim to their audiences.
</p>
<p>
    Now, you may be wondering why we spent so much time on Origen’s character,
    influence, and motives. The simple answer is that the smear campaign
    against him was so effective that many people would not consider his
    thoughts seriously if we did not first debunk the myths and rumors
    surrounding him. Hopefully, now we can see, as so many scholars have seen,
    that “there is much reason to justify Jerome’s first judgment that Origen
    was the greatest teacher of the early church after the Apostles” (Chadwick,
    2017). With this understanding, let us now consider his words on the scope
    of salvation and the purpose of judgment.
</p>
<h4>
    Origen’s Views
</h4>
<p>
    Origen, like his predecessor Clement, natively spoke Greek. It is important
    to remember this as we consider his interpretations of Scriptures: he was
    reading them in his own tongue at a time near that of the apostles. With
    this in mind, let’s consider how he understands 1 Corinthians 15:28, which
    says “When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also
    be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God
    may be all in all.”
</p>
	<blockquote>
		I am of opinion that the expression, by which God is said to be all in all,
    means that He is all in each individual person. Now He will be all in each
    individual in this way: when all which any rational understanding, cleansed
    from the dregs of every sort of vice, and with every cloud of wickedness
    completely swept away, can either feel, or understand, or think, will be
    wholly God; and when it will no longer behold or retain anything else than
    God, but when God will be the measure and standard of all its movements;
    and thus God will be all, for there will no longer be any distinction of
    good and evil, seeing evil nowhere exists; for God is all things, and to
    Him no evil is near: nor will there be any longer a desire to eat from the
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil, on the part of him who is always in
    the possession of good, and to whom God is all. So then, when the end has
    been restored to the beginning, and the termination of things compared with
    their commencement, that condition of things will be re-established in
    which rational nature was placed, when it had no need to eat of the tree of
    the knowledge of good and evil; so that when all feeling of wickedness has
    been removed, and the individual has been purified and cleansed, He who
    alone is the one good God becomes to him all, and that not in the case of a
    few individuals, or of a considerable number, but He Himself is all in all.
    And when death shall no longer anywhere exist, nor the sting of death, nor
any evil at all, then verily God will be all in all. (<em><a href="http://newadvent.org/fathers/04123.htm">De Principiis</a></em>, Book 3, Chapter 6, section 3)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Origen’s view on the phrase “all in all” is most reasonable. Prior to my
    research into the scope of salvation, this phrase held little sensible
    meaning for me. I remember singing a worship song that said “my all in all”
    and thinking that the phrase was simply odd and rather meaningless. The
    reason, I think, for this most remarkable phrase becoming gibberish to me
    is that my former worldview prevented me from seeing its clear meaning.
    Contemplating this phrase after being freed from this unreasonable
    paradigm, however, I came to the same conclusion as Origen: that God will
    be everything to everyone. In other words, he will so permeate our beings
    with his love and goodness that we will desire nothing else but the
    treasure of knowing Him. This will be true for everyone. That is why there
    are two “alls” in the phrase “all in all.” He will be all (everything) that
    we know or desire as all evil will be completely destroyed, <em>in </em>all
    (everyone). This is the true end game of the gospel, not a dichotomous
    reality of permanent misery and wickedness for most, and unending bliss for
    a few. Instead God will eradicate evil by completely healing every
    individual to the point that they all fully understand and love Him. He
    becomes, in each person’s soul, all to them.
</p>
<p>
    This understanding of God’s ultimate purpose is discussed by Origen on
    multiple occasions. Consider the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		An end or consummation would seem to be an indication of the perfection and
    completion of things … The end of the world, then, and the final
    consummation, will take place when every one shall be subjected to
    punishment for his sins; a time which God alone knows, when He will bestow
    on each one what he deserves. We think, indeed, that the goodness of God,
    through His Christ, may recall all His creatures to one end, even His
    enemies being conquered and subdued. For thus says holy Scripture, The Lord
    said to My Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your
    footstool. And if the meaning of the prophet's language here be less clear,
    we may ascertain it from the Apostle Paul, who speaks more openly, thus:
    For Christ must reign until He has put all enemies under His feet. But if
    even that unreserved declaration of the apostle do not sufficiently inform
    us what is meant by enemies being placed under His feet, listen to what he
    says in the following words, For all things must be put under Him. What,
    then, is this putting under by which all things must be made subject to
    Christ? I am of opinion that it is this very subjection by which we also
    wish to be subject to Him, by which the apostles also were subject, and all
    the saints who have been followers of Christ. For the name subjection, by
    which we are subject to Christ, indicates that the salvation which proceeds
    from Him belongs to His subjects, agreeably to the declaration of David,
Shall not my soul be subject unto God? From Him comes my salvation. (<em><a href="http://newadvent.org/fathers/04121.htm">De Principiis</a></em>
    , Book I, chapter 6, section 1)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that Origen is basing his reasoning on several Bible passages. He
    references Psalm 110:1/ Matthew 22:44, 1 Corinthians 15:25-28, and Psalm 62
    (the Septuagint version*). Origen’s understanding of the meaning of
    subjection as willing obedience is based on Scripture. It is the same
    subjection that we strive for as believers, the same subjection that all
    saints have strived for, and the same subjection that king David considers
    to be an obvious aim for himself (to submit to the God who is his
    salvation). It is quite apparent that Origen is correct in asserting this
    to be the meaning of “subjection.” In order to demonstrate this truth, we
    simply need to read 1 Corinthians 15:28 in context: “When all things are
    subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who
    put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.” Notice
that all things are <em>subjected</em> to the Son, and then the    <em>Son himself is subjected to the Father.</em> Is this subjection of the
    Son to the Father unwilling? How then, can anyone be justified in claiming
    that the subjection of all to Christ is forced, unwilling subjection? The
    immediate context clearly prohibits such an interpretation as the very same
    word is used to describe both.
</p>
	<div class="box">
		*In the Septuagint, Psalm 62 opens with the following lines:
    “Shall not my soul be subject unto God? From Him comes my salvation.”
    Origen seems to be quoting from there. In many English versions, it is
    translated differently. If you are feeling weird about quoting from the
    Septuagint you should know that Jesus Himself quoted it. For example
    according to Christianity Today, “The one time we are told that Jesus
    himself read Scripture in the synagogue, the text he read followed the LXX
    (see Luke 4:16-19)” (<a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1999/april26/9t5098.html">https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1999/april26/9t5098.html
    </a>
). You can see the Septuagint version for yourself    <a href="http://ecmarsh.com/lxx/Psalms/index.htm">here</a> and download it
    for free with the Greek <a href="https://apostolicbible.com/">here</a>.
	</div>
<p>
    Origen sees this state of subjection as it is described as pertaining to
    all individuals, even to God’s enemies, because of God’s goodness. This is
    indeed how he conquers his enemies: by making them friends and loyal
    subjects. As he states elsewhere, the destruction of God’s enemy means that
    “its mind and hostile will, which came not from God, but from itself, are
    to be destroyed. Its destruction, therefore, will not be its non-existence,
but its ceasing to be an enemy…” (<em><a href="http://newadvent.org/fathers/04123.htm">De Principiis</a></em>
    , Book 3, Chapter 6, Section 5). The reason for this ability of God to
    change and redeem even his enemies is His sovereignty over all, “for
    nothing is impossible to the Omnipotent, nor is anything incapable of
    restoration to its Creator” (<em>Ibid). </em>As Christ himself stated,
    “with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26).
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
    Origen furthermore anchors his hope for universal reconciliation (known in
    the Greek as <em>apokatastasis/</em>ἀποκατάστασις<em>)</em> in the
    resurrection. In contrast to those who believe in complete destruction of
    human flesh by death such that “it retains no relic at all of its former
    substance,” Origen says this:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		We, however, who believe in its resurrection, understand that a change only
    has been produced by death, but that its substance certainly remains; and
    that by the will of its Creator, and at the time appointed, it will be
    restored to life; and that a second time a change will take place in it, so
    that what at first was flesh (formed) out of earthly soil, and was
    afterwards dissolved by death, and again reduced to dust and ashes (For
    dust you are, it is said, and to dust shall you return), will be again
    raised from the earth, and shall after this, according to the merits of the
    indwelling soul, advance to the glory of a spiritual body.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		Into this condition, then, we are to suppose that all this bodily substance
    of ours will be brought, when all things shall be re-established in a state
    of unity, and when God shall be all in all. And this result must be
    understood as being brought about, not suddenly, but slowly and gradually,
    seeing that the process of amendment and correction will take place
    imperceptibly in the individual instances during the lapse of countless and
    unmeasured ages, some outstripping others, and tending by a swifter course
    towards perfection, while others again follow close at hand, and some again
    a long way behind; and thus, through the numerous and uncounted orders of
    progressive beings who are being reconciled to God from a state of enmity,
    the last enemy is finally reached, who is called death, so that he also may
    be destroyed, and no longer be an enemy. When, therefore, all rational
    souls shall have been restored to a condition of this kind, then the nature
    of this body of ours will undergo a change into the glory of a spiritual
    body.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, Origen is basing his understanding on multiple passages of Scripture
and a right understanding of the Greek words <em>aion</em> and    <em>aionios</em> as relating to ages (it, of course, makes sense that he
would have the right understanding of these words as a native speaker of    <em>koine</em> Greek near to the time of the writings of the New
    Testament). For example, his understanding of the transformation from a
    natural body to a spiritual body comes directly from 1 Corinthians
    15:42-44:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable;
    what is raised is imperishable.<strong> </strong> It is sown in dishonor;
it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.    <strong> </strong> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual
    body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
	</blockquote>
<p>
    For Origen, the resurrection of the dead could not possibly be a
    resurrection to eternal conscious torment. Such an idea flies in the face
    of many biblical passages that make it quite clear that the subjection
    described in 1 Corinthians 15 is also unity, as he references above (from
    Ephesians 1) and reconciliation (see Colossians 1 and 2 Corinthians 5).
    This being said, Origen also understands the biblical picture that judgment
    still occurs, but that said judgment is a process of amendment and
    correction that takes place over ages until all are reconciled to God and
    He becomes all in all.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding this process by which God righteously judges and refines, Origen
    utilizes the biblical symbol of fire. One example of this can be seen in
    Origen’s writing against the philosopher Celsus who was accusing the
    Christian God of cruelty and “coming down like a torturer bearing fire.” To
    correct Celsus’ misconception, address his mocking accusation, and explain
    the biblical meaning of the symbol of fire, Origen says the following:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		The divine word says that our God is a consuming fire, and that He draws
    rivers of fire before Him; nay, that He even enters in as a refiner's fire,
    and as a fuller's herb, to purify His own people. But when He is said to be
    a consuming fire, we inquire what are the things which are appropriate to
    be consumed by God. And we assert that they are wickedness, and the works
    which result from it, and which, being figuratively called wood, hay,
    stubble, God consumes as a fire... For (the Scripture) says: The fire will
    try each man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he
    has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work be
    burned, he shall suffer loss. But what work can be spoken of in these words
    as being burned, save all that results from wickedness? Therefore our God
    is a consuming fire in the sense in which we have taken the word; and thus
    He enters in as a refiner's fire, to refine the rational nature, which has
    been filled with the lead of wickedness, and to free it from the other
    impure materials, which adulterate the natural gold or silver, so to speak,
    of the soul. And, in like manner, rivers of fire are said to be before God,
    who will thoroughly cleanse away the evil which is intermingled throughout
    the whole soul. But these remarks are sufficient in answer to the
    assertion, that thus they were made to give expression to the erroneous
    opinion that God will come down bearing fire like a torturer. (<em><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04164.htm">Contra Celsum</a>, Book IV,
    </em>
    Chapter 13)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Again, we see Origen’s understanding of the symbol of fire being informed
    by the biblical text. He cites many of the same passages that I cited
    earlier
    <a href="../4_Symbolism/2_fireandworms.html">
        here&nbsp;
    </a>
    &nbsp;(feel free to check them out again by clicking the link). It is important
    to notice that Origen’s motivation here is to defend the Christian faith
    and the very character of God, by offering a biblically sound and
    consistent interpretation of the symbol of fire. Curiously, many
    theologians after Origen seem to have forgotten that torturing human beings
    is actually a bad thing and try to defend the idea that God is justified in
    being a torturer, rather than using the many references to fire as a
    purifying agent in Scripture to prove that He is not. Even Celsus, who was
    working diligently to attack Christianity, was too in touch with conscience
    and human decency to make such an error; his very premise in attacking
    Christianity is based on the basic understanding that purposeless torture
    is wrong.
</p>
<p>
    Some modern theologians do recognize this moral problem but still cling to
    the “eternal conscious torment” view. But these men, who rightly wish to
    absolve God of the accusation of being a torturer, neglect to consider the
    biblical symbolism. Instead, they assert (with no biblical support) that
    people choose to separate themselves from God forever in hell. I would
    challenge those who claim this view to find one biblical reference in which
    fire symbolizes separation. I doubt that any will be found, especially
    because fire cannot reasonably symbolize separation (the idea makes no
    sense).
</p>
<p>
    Origen, on the other hand, studied the Bible with incredible diligence and
    saw the consistent biblical theme of fire as purifying. This is why he
    describes God as a consuming fire burning away wickedness from the soul, as
    a refiner of metals removes lead from gold. This is also why he understands
    that God’s fire will test each man’s work and burn away the wood, hay, and
    stubble. It is truly because of Origen’s biblical knowledge that he comes
    to the conclusion that the fire of judgment is purposeful and results in
    the ultimate restoration of the sinner to a right relationship with God.
</p>
<p>
    Due of this understanding, Origen, like Clement before him, also compares
    God’s corrective punishments to the curative measures of a physician.
</p>
	<blockquote>
		There are also many other things which escape our notice, and are known to
    Him alone who is the physician of our souls. For if, on account of those
    bad effects which we bring upon ourselves by eating and drinking, we deem
    it necessary for the health of the body to make use of some unpleasant and
    painful drug, sometimes even, if the nature of the disease demand,
    requiring the severe process of the amputating knife; and if the virulence
    of the disease shall transcend even these remedies, the evil has at last to
    be burned out by fire; how much more is it to be understood that God our
    Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls, which they had
    contracted from their different sins and crimes, should employ penal
    measures of this sort, and should apply even, in addition, the punishment
    of fire to those who have lost their soundness of mind! Pictures of this
    method of procedure are found also in the holy Scriptures. In the book of
    Deuteronomy, the divine word threatens sinners with the punishments of
    fevers, and colds, and jaundice, and with the pains of feebleness of
    vision, and alienation of mind and paralysis, and blindness, and weakness
    of the reins. If any one, then, at his leisure gather together out of the
    whole of Scripture all the enumerations of diseases which in the
    threatenings addressed to sinners are called by the names of bodily
    maladies, he will find that either the vices of souls, or their
    punishments, are figuratively indicated by them. To understand now, that in
    the same way in which physicians apply remedies to the sick, in order that
    by careful treatment they may recover their health, God so deals towards
    those who have lapsed and fallen into sin, is proved by this, that the cup
    of God's fury is ordered, through the agency of the prophet Jeremiah, to be
    offered to all nations, that they may drink it, and be in a state of
    madness, and vomit it forth. In doing which, He threatens them, saying,
    that if any one refuse to drink, he shall not be cleansed. By which
    certainly it is understood that the fury of God's vengeance is profitable
    for the purgation of souls. That the punishment, also, which is said to be
    applied by fire, is understood to be applied with the object of healing, is
    taught by Isaiah, who speaks thus of Israel: The Lord will wash away the
    filth of the sons or daughters of Zion, and shall purge away the blood from
    the midst of them by the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning. Of
    the Chaldeans he thus speaks: You have the coals of fire; sit upon them:
    they will be to you a help. And in other passages he says, The Lord will
    sanctify in a burning fire and in the prophecies of Malachi he says, The
    Lord sitting will blow, and purify, and will pour forth the cleansed sons
of Judah. (<em><a href="http://newadvent.org/fathers/04122.htm">De Principiis</a></em>
    , Book II, chapter 10, section 6)
	</blockquote>
<p>
    Once again, Origen bases his understanding of God’s role as the great
    physician of human souls on numerous Scripture passages. His understanding
    of fire as a tool used by God to heal us of the sickness of sin is also
    clearly based on the Bible. It is highly doubtful that many people in all
    of history have been more familiar with the Scriptures than Origen, who
    spent his entire life studying them with incredible diligence. Perhaps it
    is worth considering that his understanding of the role of fire and
    punishment as disciplinary and healing might actually be correct. A man of
    impeccable Christian character and unmatched intellect who labored
    meticulously and successfully to spread the Christian faith through reason
    (not force), and who suffered persecution and tortures for it, should not
    be flippantly written off as a heretic. Instead, it would be wise to
    consider his interpretation of the scope of God’s salvation and His
    purposes in judgment, since they are clearly based on a rich understanding
    of God’s goodness and power as described in the Bible itself.
