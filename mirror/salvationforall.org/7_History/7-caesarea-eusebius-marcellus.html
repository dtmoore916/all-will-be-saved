<h1>
    Eusebius and Marcellus of Ancyra</h1>
<p>
    In my research of Eusebius of Caesarea, I more or less stumbled into reading 
	some very interesting excerpts by Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra, that were 
	quoted by Eusebius. For this reason, I decided to include a small piece on 
	him here, and depart briefly from my focus on the theological schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	A bit about Marcellus:</p>
	<p>
    Marcellus of Ancyra (c. 280-375 A.D.) attended the council of Nicaea in 325 
	A.D. as a strong opponent of Arianism (a view that largely denied Christ's 
	divinity).&nbsp; Although it is not entirely clear how influential Marcellus 
	was at this council, it is clear that he was one of the bishops who approved 
	of the Nicene creed formulated there.&nbsp; As a reminder, the Nicene creed 
	is a fundamental statement of orthodox Christian belief that the vast 
	majority of Christians adhere to.&nbsp; Eusebius also attended the council 
	of Nicaea with Marcellus, but later wrote two works against his writings 
	about Christ.&nbsp; It seems that Marcellus' strong anti-Arian stance led 
	him to embrace what could be considered the opposite error, unifying Christ 
	to the Father so tightly that the distinction between the persons of the 
	Trinity became blurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ was considered more of&nbsp; a 
	"mode" of the Godhead than a "person" of the Trinity.&nbsp; This 
	over-emphasis on the unity of the Godhead (sometimes called modalism, or 
	Sabellianism), is understandable given certain scriptural passages like John 
	10:30, in which Jesus states: "I and the Father are one."&nbsp; Perhaps this 
	is why Saint Athanasius of Alexandria is reported to have said that 
	Marcellus was “not far from error, but that he was to be excused”
	<a href="https://www.fourthcentury.com/marcellus-of-ancyra/">(Fourth Century 
	Christianity, citing Epiphanius'&nbsp;<em>Panarion</em>&nbsp;72.4.4).</a>
</p>
	<p>
    Although this website is not about early Christological controversies, this 
	context is necessary in order to understand what Eusebius was opposing in 
	Marcellus.&nbsp; Both Marcellus and Eusebius, as well as many of the early 
	church fathers who formulated the Nicene creed, believed in universal 
	restoration.&nbsp; Eusebius opposed his Christology, not his views on 
	restoration.&nbsp; This controversy, however, seems to have been useful in 
	preserving Marcellus' thoughts for posterity since Eusebius quotes him 
	extensively (and many of his own works have been lost).&nbsp; It is clear 
	from these preserved passages that Marcellus too believed in the ultimate 
	restoration of all to God and that he based this view on scripture.</p>
	<p>
    &nbsp;One such scriptural passage referenced by Marcellus (and many other 
	early church fathers) that deserves further attention is Acts 3:21.&nbsp; It
    says the following about Jesus: “Heaven must receive him until the
    time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through
    his holy prophets.” This verse was highly significant for many of the early
    restorationists. In fact, the belief held by many of the church fathers
    that all would eventually be restored to God is often referred to by the
Greek word used here: <em>apokatastasis</em> (ἀποκατάστασις).    <em>&nbsp;Apokatastasis</em> means restoration and since Acts 3:21 refers to it
    as the “<em>apokatastaseos panton,</em>”<em> </em>it is clear that the
    restoration of all (everyone and everything) is the correct meaning of the
    verse (<em>panton </em>means all).
</p>
<p>
    Another reason why the word <em>apokatastasis </em>is worth remembering is
    that it is the very word that Justinian sought (but failed) to fully
anathematize:<em> “If anyone supports the monstrous doctrine of apokatastasis [τὴ</em><em>ν</em><em> </em><em>τερατώδη</em><em> ἀ</em><em>ποκατάστασιν</em>    <em>], be it anathema</em><em>”</em> 
	(Kimel 2018). It is rather fascinating to note that emperor Justinian here 
	attempted to curse a concept preached by the apostle Peter in his second sermon in the book of Acts. Ultimately,
the council often associated with the condemnation of    <em>apokatastasis</em> only ended up condemning the concept as it was
    associated with other Platonic and unscriptural ideas. Importantly, it did
    not anathematize the idea of universal restoration itself, but only as it
    was connected with these other ideas (e.g. the pre-existence of the soul, 
	etc.) in certain writers.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, in spite of Justinian’s later attempt to anathematize Peter’s
    statement, and eviscerate it of its true meaning, Marcellus, like so many
    Greek-speaking early fathers, took it to mean what it said:
</p>
	<blockquote>
		What else does the expression ‘until the times of <em>apokatastasis</em>’
    [ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως] indicate to us, if not the aeon to come, in
    which <strong>all beings must receive their perfect restoration</strong>
    [δεῖ πάντα τῆς τελείας τυχεῖν ἀποκαταστάσεως]? [. . .] On the occasion of
    the restoration of <strong>absolutely all beings</strong> [τῆς ἀποκαταστάσεως ἁπάντων], as
    Paul says, the creation itself will pass on from slavery to freedom. For he
    says: ‘Creation itself will be liberated from the slavery of corruption to
the freedom of the glory of the children of God,’ (etc). (Ramelli, citing    <em>Against Marcellus</em> 2.4.11)
	</blockquote>
<p>
Ramelli points out that this view "characterizes the final    <em>apokatastasis</em> 
as unity.” Marcellus undoubtedly derives this understanding
    from Ephesians 1:8-10 which tells us God’s ultimate purpose for everything
    is unity under Christ as follows: “With all wisdom and understanding, he
    made known to us the
        mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed
        in Christ, to be put into effect    <strong>when the times reach their fulfillment</strong>—to bring
    <strong>
        <em>unity</em>
        to <em>all things</em> in heaven and on earth under Christ.</strong>” The <em>apokatastasis panton</em>
    
        (restoration of all things) preached by Peter in Acts is this very
        unity of all under Christ. It is the same unity described in
        Philippians 2:9-11 (and elsewhere) when
    
    <em>every</em>
    knee bows<em> and </em>
    <em>every</em>
   
        tongue confesses Jesus as Lord to God’s glory, and is the reason why
        the Greek terms for bowing and confessing denote
    
    <em>whole-hearted, willing worship</em>
    <em>.</em>
    It is the reconciliation of <em>all</em> things
        to Christ described in Colossians 1 and the reason why 2 Corinthians
        5:19 describes God as “<em>reconciling the world to himself</em>
        in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them.” It is why Jesus is
        described in Scripture as the “Savior of <em>the world</em>” (John 4:42 and 1
        John 4:14) and the "Savior of <em>all people"</em> (1 Timothy 4:10), and why He
        Himself says that he came to “save the world” (John 12:47).
</p>
	<p>
	Eusebius did not oppose this reasoning; he agreed with it.&nbsp; The part of 
	Marcellus' reasoning that Eusebius contradicted was the notion that Christ 
	was merely a "mode" of God that had a beginning and that would be 
	essentially re-absorbed into God and have an end.&nbsp; He refers to this as 
	reckless innovation, "granting a beginning... to the kingdom of Christ, and 
	having determined an end of this, and denying the truly only-begotten Son of 
	God and assuming [that he is] a mere word, without being and 
	non-subsistent..."
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-1DDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=eusebius+against+marcellus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D4C0YeClkW&amp;sig=rlQHrFdj8MjByrOTHFHI_-3Jnog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3x6vN2oXdAhUKeawKHUp0DIw4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Restoration&amp;f=false">
	(<em>Against Marcellus</em> page 152).</a>&nbsp; So, what Eusebius is 
	criticizing in Marcellus is a misunderstanding of the nature of the Trinity.&nbsp; 
	He never mentions a word against <em>apokatastasis</em>.&nbsp; He does, 
	however, explain how his view of <em>apokatastasis</em> differed from that 
	of Marcellus in his second work against his modalism, as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>
		As the apostle when he said <strong>all </strong>shall be subjected to the Son 
		<strong>did not mean
    union of essence, but obedience flowing from free-will, together with the
    honor and glory which all give him as the Saviour, and King of all, in the
    same way his subjection to the Father means nothing else than the glory,
    and honor, and veneration, and exaltation, and voluntary subjection, which
    he is to give to God the Father</strong>, when he has made <strong>all</strong> worthy of his
    paternal Godhead. For, so long as they are not worthy of this, he,
    anticipating the future as a common Saviour of <strong>all</strong>, administers a kingdom
    	<strong>restorative of the imperfect and curative of those who need healing</strong>...
		Christ is to subject <strong>all</strong> things to himself. We ought to conceive of this as
    such a salutary subjection as that by which the Son will be subjected to
    him, who subjects <strong>all</strong> to him. We ought to believe that he will effect a
    subjection ineffable, indescribable, and befitting him alone, when he shall
    present to God, even the Father, those subjected to himself, collecting
    them like a heavenly choir ascribing to him glory and honor and salvation
    and majesty, who is the source and cause of all good things.

    &nbsp;(Beecher 1878, citing Eusebius' work, <em>On Ecclesiastical Theology</em>,
    Migne vi., p. 1030-1031)</a></blockquote>
<p>
    It is critical to notice that Eusebius agrees with Marcellus that <em>all</em> 
	will be restored.&nbsp; His contention is that this restoration will consist 
	in free, voluntary, whole-hearted obedience to God for all, rather than in 
	"union of essence."&nbsp; He will make everyone worthy to partake of God in 
	loving submission while still retaining individuality and personhood.&nbsp; 
	Neither Jesus nor humanity will be absorbed into God in such a way that we 
	become non-existent.&nbsp; Instead we will be restored by becoming like 
	Christ, perfect in our faithfulness to the Father.</p>
	<p>
    What is most interesting to me about this whole debate is that the 
	restoration of all is never even questioned; it is assumed.&nbsp; Of course 
	all will be restored.&nbsp; It is practically taken for granted that 
	everyone in the church agrees on that fact.&nbsp; The <em>apokatastaseos 
	panton</em> preached by Peter in Acts is never doubted, even by church 
	fathers who disagreed sharply about Christology.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    In short, the interpretations of Eusebius, Marcellus, and many other Greek-speaking
    fathers of the restoration of all things is a harmonious reading of many
    passages of Scripture. It does not require the intellectual gymnastics of
    those who deny what the Bible is teaching and thereby insist that “the
    world” does not really mean “the world,” and that “all” really only means
    “some (who happen to be us)” or that reconciliation and unity actually mean
    “separation and torment” for most people. Instead, these early church
    fathers, reading the Bible in their native tongue, understood its plain
    meaning and did not feel the need to rewrite the text to fit preconceived
    notions and traditions about the eternality of hell. They were free, as we
    should be, to read these beautiful passages as they were intended, without
    imposing centuries of dark ages theology and confusion on the text.
