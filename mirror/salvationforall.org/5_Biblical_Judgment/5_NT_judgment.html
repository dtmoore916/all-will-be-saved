<h1>
    The Judgment and Wrath of God in the New Testament
</h1>
<p>
    So far we have been looking at examples of judgment in the Old Testament
    and have seen that they were always purposeful and lasted for a limited
    duration, eventually resulting in restoration. Does God change his pattern
    for justice in the New Testament and decide to punish people forever? This
    is an interesting question, because the Old Testament does not teach a
    doctrine of everlasting punishment in hell. The only potential support for
    the idea is in Daniel 12:2, but we  have already seen through a brief word study that
the word translated “everlasting” (transliterated <em>olam</em> or    <em>ovlam</em>) is not translated accurately, and actually refers to limited duration. With this understanding let’s
    look at some of the passages in the New Testament about judgment.
</p>
<h3>
    John 3:16-21
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “For God so loved <strong>the world</strong>, that he gave his only Son,
    that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For
God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but    <strong>in order that the world might be saved through him</strong>.
Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is    <strong>condemned already</strong>, because he has not believed in the name
    of the only Son of God. And <strong>this is the judgment</strong>: the
    light has come into the world, and
    <strong>
        people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works
        were evil
    </strong>
. For everyone who does wicked things    <strong>hates the light and does not come to the light</strong>, lest his
    works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light,
    so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in
    God.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    John 3:16-17 is one of the most beloved verses in all of the Bible because
    it shows the great love of God for us. We are told that Jesus came not to
    condemn the world, but to save it.
</p>
<p>
    Supporters of the doctrine of eternal punishment, however, say that this
    message of hope then takes a dark turn. They will say that the condemnation
    described for unbelievers is eternal hell.
</p>
<p>
    But this interpretation is clearly wrong! We know this because the passage
    tells us what the condemnation is! Read it again. You should notice a
    couple of things.
</p>
<p>
    1. Those who don’t believe are condemned <em>already</em>. In other words,
    they are experiencing their judgment in the present. Are they in a place of
    eternal torment right now? Obviously not!
</p>
<p>
    2. The judgment is that the “people loved the darkness rather than the
    light because their works were evil.” In other words, people are condemned
    to live in darkness until they come to belief in Christ, the light of the
    world. And many don’t want to come to this light because of their
    wickedness. So the judgment they experience is that God allows them to
    remain in it.
</p>
<p>
    This concept of judgment is further elucidated in Romans 1, where Paul says
    that “the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven.” We see that the
    wrath of God revealed in the passage is that God “gave them over” to “the
    sinful desires of their hearts,” to “shameful lusts” and to “a depraved
mind” because they refused to acknowledge Him. It also says that they “<em>received</em> in themselves the due penalty for their error.” Notice
    that the word “received” is in past tense, showing that they have already
    experienced condemnation. This wrath is not a future hellfire, but a
    present darkness.
</p>
<p>
    And once again, we see a purpose to God’s wrath and judgment: “For God has
consigned all to disobedience, that    <strong>he may have mercy on all</strong>” (<a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A32&amp;version=ESV"
    >Romans 11:32</a>). Prior to belief, we were    <em>all condemned to darkness and disobedience.</em> But God is not content
    to leave us in this state. He allows us to do what we want for a time, so
    that He can have mercy on us and show us just how great and unfathomable
    His love really is!
</p>
<h2>
    What about Final Judgment?
</h2>
<p>
    It is true that there is also a final judgment described in the New
    Testament. We have seen, however that the passages referencing Gehenna
    (translated “hell”) may or may not be referring to this final judgment.
    Instead they may be referencing the literal destruction of Jerusalem in
    A.D. 70 in which many were cast, unburied into the dump outside of
    Jerusalem (Gehenna). Whether this is symbolic of the future, final judgment
    of mankind is debatable, but I think that it is a reasonable inference that
    Gehenna is meant to be symbolic of the final judgment, as well as literally
    descriptive of the A.D. 70 destruction of Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
    This being the case, the best descriptions of the final judgment of
    humanity can be seen in Revelation’s descriptions of the White Throne
    judgment and the lake of fire (also called the second death).
</p>
<p>
    We have already looked at some of these passages, showing that the words
    translated “forever and ever” did not necessarily have this sense in the
    Greek. It is worthwhile to look at these passages again. They can be found
    in Revelation 2, 14, 20, and 21. So we see that there is certainly a final
    judgment that occurs and that people are cast into the lake of fire. As a
    reminder, we have already discussed the symbolism of fire throughout the
    Bible and seen that fire is most often used to symbolize purification by
    God. We have also seen that “everyone will be salted with fire” (Mark
    9:49).
</p>
<p>
    But does the book of Revelation end with judgment, fire, brimstone, and
    hopelessness for the lost? The answer is NO! There are two more chapters
    that <em>come after </em>the judgment. Let’s examine these now.
</p>

<h3>
    Revelation 21:1-6
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first
    earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city,
    new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride
    adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
    “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them,
    and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their
    God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no
    more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for
    the former things have passed away.”

<br>
    And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things
    new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and
    true.” And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
    beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the
    water of life without payment.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that <em>after</em> judgment, we see a new heaven and a new earth.
    We see that God is “<em>making</em> <em>all </em>things new,” a complete
    restoration <em>in process</em>. We see the end of all pain and loss. We
    see that the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ has descended to earth.
    This refers to the church, the true followers of Christ (Ephesians 5, and
    elsewhere). A beautiful picture of God’s ultimate plan of redemption
    emerges.
</p>
<p>
    But, advocates of eternal punishment will be quick to point out that the
    following verses take a dark turn, away from hope for the lost. I will not
    ignore these verses, as you might have expected. Instead we will examine
them <em>carefully</em> and see that hope in fact remains for “His mercy    <em>endures</em> forever” (Psalm 136 says so 26 times).
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 21: 7-8
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he
    will be my son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as
    for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars,
    their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is
    the second death.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Hellfire advocates at this point might say “See! I told you all those evil
    people will burn!” But let’s remember that we <em>are</em> those evil
    people, as Jesus pointed out when he clarified the law as pertaining to the
    state of the heart, saying that if we have lusted, we have committed
    adultery, and if we have hated, we have committed murder (Matthew 5). God’s
    standard is much higher than our own, and we must not be hypocritical and
    judge others as inferior “for in the same way you judge others, you will be
    judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you” (Matthew
    7:2).&nbsp; That should give us pause, but it isn’t the only reason to hold out
    hope for those who have been judged. Instead we must <em>read on</em> and
    Revelation will give us this beautiful, hopeful picture. Don’t end your
    reading here, because this isn’t where the book ends!
    <br/>
    Let’s continue our study to see what New Jerusalem (the bride of Christ/
    the church) is like.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 21:25-27
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong>On no day will its gates ever be shut</strong>, for there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will
    be brought into it. Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who
    does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written
    in the Lamb’s book of life.
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is important to notice here that the gates of New Jerusalem are never
    shut. The only reason to leave gates open is to allow passage through them.
    The text tells us, in fact, that things will pass through, including the
    “glory and honor of the nations.” Is this just gold, rubies and diamonds?&nbsp; Does the church become a materialistic entity, intent on the accumulation
    of wealth, but uncaring toward lost souls? Hasn’t this attitude been
    forcefully condemned throughout Scripture?
</p>
<p>
    What does God really treasure? Doesn’t He love the world so much that He
    sent Jesus to save it as John 3:16 tells us?&nbsp; Doesn’t He search for the lost
    with fervor, even if only one is missing? Consider Matthew 18:12-14:
</p>
<blockquote>
    “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders
    away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the
    one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier
    about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In
    the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little
    ones should perish.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that God is not content to let anyone escape salvation. He will seek
    us out. He will find us, (100% of us) because that is His will. And there
    will be great joy! This theme is reiterated again and again. Let’s take a
    look.
</p>
<h3>
    Luke 15:8-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not
    light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?
    And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors,
    saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ Just
    so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who
    repents.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice the diligent seeking. We are the coins and God, like the woman in the parable, does
    not stop pursuing us until we are all found.
</p>
<p>
    And consider the beauty of the parable of the prodigal son. The Father is
    searching for His son and sees him while he is still far away. Luke 15:20
    says “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt
    compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.” Why did the Father
    see the son from such a far distance? It was because He was looking for
    him, longingly awaiting his return. And when the rebellious, decadent son,
    who squandered his inheritance returns, the Father says, “Bring quickly the
    best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his
    feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and
    celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
    is found” (Luke 15:22-24).
</p>
<p>
    The only person angry about this is the son who felt as if he was the one
    who <em>deserved</em> the love of the Father, not his sinful brother. But
    the Father gently corrects this son, saying “Son, you are always with me,
    and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for
    this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found” (Luke
    15:31-32). If we religiously assume superiority over sinners, we miss the
    heart of God, who celebrates the return of the “dead” to Him.&nbsp; Why do we
    assume that the second death is any different? Indeed we will see that
    Revelation tells us that it is not.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 22:1-5
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as
crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb    
    down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river
    stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit
every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.    No
    longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be
in the city, and his servants will serve him.    
They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.&nbsp;
    There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the
    light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will
    reign for ever and ever.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice the river of the water of life and the tree of life flowing through
    the city and that the leaves of the tree “are for the healing of the
    nations.” If everyone is perfect why are these healing leaves needed? There
    seems to be a process here. Let’s examine it next.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 22:14
</h3>
<blockquote>
        Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to
        the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is after the New Jerusalem has already descended to earth. We, the
    church are the New Jerusalem, the bride of Christ. We are already in the
    city, we are part of it. Who, then, can wash their robes and enter? It must
    be those who were unclean and therefore unable to enter before, those who
    have been cast into the lake of fire. If Gehenna (translated “hell”) is
    symbolic of this judgment, it must be noted that Gehenna (the Valley of
    Hinnom) was geographically located right outside of Jerusalem. So, the
    imagery is that those who are outside, the ones who will be blessed to wash
    their robes and enter the city, are those who are unrighteous presently,
    but being purified by God’s consuming fire. Indeed, this is confirmed in
    the very next verse:
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 22:15
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral,
    the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices
    falsehood.
</blockquote>
<p>
    We are told exactly who has the opportunity to come into the city once they
    are purified (symbolized by the washing of their robes). These robes must
    be washed in Jesus’ blood. As we see in Revelation 7:14, the saints have
    “washed their <strong>robes</strong> and made them white in the blood of
    the Lamb.” This very imagery is used here. Jesus is the way, the truth, and
    the life for all people and nothing can separate us from His love, not even
    the second death. But we can’t come into the city until we are purified of
    evil, so we remain outside until we repent and are washed in His blood.
    Many say this is true of Christians only, but it is true of everyone
    because everyone will become true Christians eventually.
</p>
<p>
    I mentioned earlier that Revelation does not end with eternal judgment.
    Let’s see how it actually ends.
</p>
<h3>
    Revelation 22:17-21
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.
    I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
<br>

    <strong>
        The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say,
        “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes
        take the free gift of the water of life.
    </strong>
<br>

    
    I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If
    anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues
described in this scroll.    
    And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take
    away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City,
    which are described in this scroll.

<br>
    He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.”
<br>

    Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
<br>
    The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Remember, this is the very end of the book. It does not say, “they will 
	continue to be tormented forever” because that isn’t the point of the book. 
	Instead it ends with a reminder of who Jesus is, followed by God’s people 
	and God’s Spirit continuing to invite people to “come!” There is a reminder 
	to the thirsty that the gift of the water of life is still free, and always 
	will be, that they can always come to the Father and He will receive them 
	with joy. There is a strict warning to believers that we are not to change 
	the words of Revelation and that the consequences of such sin will result in 
	a loss of our inheritance as good and faithful servants. I believe this is 
	referring to our participation in the first resurrection and being part of 
	the New Jerusalem as it descends to earth. Our inheritance as leaders in 
	God’s kingdom will be lost, but God, like the Good Shepherd, the woman who 
	lost her coin, and the Father who longingly sought his prodigal son,
    will seek us and purify us, even in the second death.&nbsp; That this death 
	will come to an end is assured to us in 1 Corinthians 15:26, which tells us 
	that "the last enemy to be destroyed is death."  Christ will reign until 
	this is accomplished and all are united in Him (as Ephesians 1:10 confirms). 
</p>
<p>
    And finally it ends with a benediction: <strong>“</strong>The grace of the
Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.” Notice that it is the    <em>grace</em> of Jesus that ends Revelation. This is what we are called to
    remember as John’s vision ends. Not the fierce judgment of God, but the
    grace. Grace is unmerited favor. That is indeed what God bestows on the
    world. Nothing can separate us from His grace, or from his love, not the
    schemes of the devil, nor our sinfulness, nor even the second death “for I
    am persuaded that neither <em>death</em> nor life, nor angels nor
    principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor
    height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us
    from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:38-39).</p>
	<p>
    Now, some will undoubtedly argue that I am taking Romans 8:38-39 out of 
	context because Paul was clearly speaking to believers.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he 
	was, of course, speaking to believers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, he was 
	speaking to believers in Rome.&nbsp;
	Does this mean that it does not apply to anyone else?&nbsp; What about 
	future believers in different geographic locations, such as ourselves?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Doesn't it also apply to us?&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course it does.&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    In fact, every single book of the Bible was written to a target audience, 
	but its truths are applied beyond that audience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the 
	Bible would be entirely irrelevant to modern people, but as we know, it is 
	not.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    So while this passage is written specifically to the elect of the church in 
	Rome, I believe it has broader applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider that the 
	text is referring to the "love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Who does God love?&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't John 3:16 tell us that He loves the 
	world?&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't Ephesians 2:4-5 tell us that he "loved us, even 
	when we were dead in our trespasses"?&nbsp; And doesn't Romans 5:8 tell us 
	that "God shows his love for us in that while we were sinners, Christ died 
	for us"?&nbsp; Indeed they do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it then appropriate to limit 
	His love in this passage as exclusively applying to a select few who are 
	already following Him?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    I don't believe that it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one reason for this belief is 
	the immediate context of Romans 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take a look.</p>
	<h3>Romans 8:18-24</h3>
	<blockquote>
     I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.&nbsp; For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it,<strong> in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God</strong>.&nbsp; We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.&nbsp; Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved...</blockquote>
<p>So in Romans 8 itself, we see that God's plan is broader than just saving us 
who call upon Him in the present.&nbsp; Instead we see the hopeful message of 
redemption of all of creation, which has been groaning in pain, waiting for the 
fulfillment of God's plan of redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the whole of creation 
only refer to rocks, trees, birds and bees?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it not also refer 
to human beings, the pinnacle of His creation, who were made in His image?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Of course it does!</p>
	<p>And this, I believe, is why Revelation ends with grace.&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
	is nothing about us that deserves God's favor, but He loves all of us in 
	spite of our sinful ways, while we are yet sinners, even before we turn to 
	Him.&nbsp; And for this reason, He does not stop pursuing us, not even in 
	death.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is love and His love never ends! (1 John 4:8, and 1 
	Corinthians 13:8).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is because of His great love and grace 
	that all people will eventually turn to Him and thus be saved through 
	Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
