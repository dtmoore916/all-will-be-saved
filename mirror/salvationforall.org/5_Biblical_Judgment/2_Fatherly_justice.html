<h2>
    The Purpose of Judgment Throughout Scripture (a Clear, Consistent Theme of
    Redemption)
</h2>
<h2>
    God the Father disciplines his children
</h2>
<p>
    One fascinating, and strangely overlooked Biblical concept in the
    discussion of hell is the fact that God is referred to as our Father.
    Interestingly, he is never referred to as our fascist dictator, or great
    tormenter!
</p>
<p>
    There is meaningful connotation to the word Father. We would do well to
    learn about God as our Father and apply this to our understanding of God’s
    purpose in judgment. Like a good father, he disciplines us in order to
    bring us to righteousness. There is abundant Scriptural support for this
    concept.
</p>
<h2>
    God is Our Father
</h2>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2%3A10&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Malachi 2:10
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?</strong>
    Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our
    fathers?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Here we see that God is the Father of all. It is clear that this is
    referring to everyone because Malachi expounds on the idea, tying the fact
    that He created us to his Fatherhood. All of humanity was created by God.
    Therefore He is the Father of us all.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, it is clear that he is not speaking to righteous people in
    this passage but rather to “faithless” people who are “profaning the
    covenant.” Yet God is our Father (whether righteous or unrighteous) because
    he is our Creator. It is impossible to intelligently argue that God is only
the Father of the righteous from this passage. Rather, He is the Father of    <em>all</em>.
</p>
<h3>
    Ephesians 4:4-6
</h3>
<blockquote>
    There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope
that belongs to your call— one Lord, one faith, one baptism,<strong> one God and Father of all</strong>, who is    <strong>over all and through all and in all</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice again that God is Father of all. And notice how the Apostle Paul
    adds that he is “over all and through all and in all.” This is done for
    emphasis to show the comprehensiveness of God’s dominion as Father. It
    would be a gross misreading of the text to suggest that God’s role as
    Father is limited to only a few.
</p>
	<p>
    Now, as final confirmation that we are all children of God, we will use 
	everyone's favorite type of bibical passage: the genealogy.&nbsp; As a 
	foundational concept to understanding the point that is about to be made, it 
	is key to understand that scripturally we are all considered children of 
	Adam in the sense that we are distant descendants.&nbsp; This is why Paul 
	says that we are "in Adam" and explains that for this reason we "all die" (1 
	Corinthians 15:22) having inherited our sinful natures from him.&nbsp;
</p>
	<h3>Genealogy in Luke 3 (only verse 38 is shown)</h3>
<blockquote>...the son of Enosh,

the son of Seth, the son of Adam,

the son of God.</blockquote>
<p>
    So we see that we are all children of God, through Adam who is described as 
	the son of God, even though he was sinful.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
	<p>
    Now that we’ve firmly established that God is the Father of all people,
    let’s examine what our Father is like.
</p>
<h2>
    What is God the Father Like?
</h2>
<h4>
    We See the Father by Looking at Christ
</h4>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A9-11&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        John 14:9-11
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know
    me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show
    us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father
    is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority,
    but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the
    Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works
    themselves.
</blockquote>
<p>
    I think that many people carry the mistaken notion that Jesus and the
    Father are very different from one another. This could not be further from
    the truth. Jesus and the Father “are one” (John 10:30) and Jesus is “the image of
    the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). When reading the Bible, it is
    impossible to not see Jesus’ overwhelming forgiveness, compassion, and love
    for all. And the character of Jesus is the perfect reflection of the
    character of the Father.
</p>
<h4>
    A Father of Mercy, Compassion and Comfort
</h4>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A3&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        1 Peter 1:3
    </a>
    ESV
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his
    great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the
    resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A3-4&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        2 Corinthians 1:3-4
    </a>
    ESV
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
    mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so
    that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the
    comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+103%3A13&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Psalm 103:13
    </a>
    ESV
</h3>
<blockquote>
    As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion
    to those who fear him.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+68%3A5&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Psalm 68:5
    </a>
    (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Father of the fatherless</strong>
    and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.
</blockquote>
<p>
    These verses hardly need commentary. Read them again to see God the
    Father’s great mercy and compassion. Let those truths sink in to your soul.
</p>

    A Father Who Knows What We Need and Gives us Good Gifts

<blockquote>
    Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
    Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.

<h3>
    Matthew 6:7-13
</h3>
<blockquote>
   
    And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they
    will be heard because of their many words. <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Do
    not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
<br>
<p class="center">
    <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>
    “This, then, is how you should pray:

    Matthew 6: 25-32
</h3>
<blockquote>
    <strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>
    “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or
    drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food,
    and the body more than clothes? <strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Look at the
    birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet
your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?    <strong><sup>27 </sup></strong>Can any one of you by worrying add a single
    hour to your life?
   
<br>
    <strong><sup>28 </sup></strong>
    “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow.
    They do not labor or spin. <strong><sup>29 </sup></strong>Yet I tell you
that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.    <strong><sup>30 </sup></strong>If that is how God clothes the grass of the
    field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he
not much more clothe you—you of little faith?    <strong><sup>31 </sup></strong>So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we
eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’    <strong><sup>32 </sup></strong>For the pagans run after all these things,
and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.    <strong><sup>33 </sup></strong>But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.    <strong><sup>34 </sup></strong>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for
    tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

    know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your
Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!    <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>So in everything, do to others what you
    would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

<p>
    Again, God’s great love for us is displayed as he shows his Fatherly
    characteristics. He knows what we need and we can trust Him.

    Ephesians 1:2-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>

    Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
    in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he
    chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy
    and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself
as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,    <strong><sup> </sup></strong>to the praise of his glorious grace, with
    which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through
    his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of
    his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making
    known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set
    forth in Christ <strong><sup> </sup></strong>as a plan for the fullness of
    time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In both of the above passages we clearly see, if we are paying attention,
    that the Father is our Redeemer. We have already established that He is the
    father to all, so it is logical that He is also the Redeemer of all, since
    these two concepts of God are inextricably tied together in Isaiah 63.
</p>
<p>
    It is also ironic that Ephesians 1:2-10 is a passage that is sometimes used
    to argue for limited atonement, that only some of us are predestined to be
    his children while the rest are predestined to hell. This is clearly NOT
    the argument being made.
</p>
<p>
    Although Paul is specifically writing to believers and reminding us of
    God’s great plan of redemption, there is no indication that only current
    believers are predestined to be adopted as sons. In fact, the opposite is
true. His plan is to unite    <em> “all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.</em>” Again,
    notice the comprehensive language being used.
</p>
<p>
    Notice, too, that God has made known to believers “the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the
    fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things
    on earth.” This passage itself tells us His will is to unite all things to
    himself! And we have confirmation in many other places that His will is the
    salvation of all people, as we have discussed already! But just as a
    reminder, let’s review a couple examples:
</p>
<h3>
    2 Peter 3:9 (NKJV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but
    is longsuffering toward us,
    <strong>
        not willing that any should perish but that <em>all</em> should come to
        repentance.
    </strong>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    1 Timothy 2
</h3>
<blockquote>
    This is good, and pleases God our Savior, <sup> </sup>who
    <strong>
        wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
    </strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
    There are many more verses that say this same thing and we’ve already
    looked at several of them in previous chapters. So, we have independent
    confirmation that God’s will is to save all mankind, that we are all
    predestined “for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ,
    according to the purpose of his will” in order to eventually be “conformed
    to the image of his Son” (Romans 8:29). It is for this very reason that we
    must be judged and disciplined.
</p>
<h2>
    God Disciplines Us Because He is Our Father
</h2>
<h3>
    <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Proverbs/3/11">
        Proverbs 3:11-12
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD Or loathe His reproof, For
    whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects the son in whom
    he delights.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Hebrews 12:5-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses
    you as a father addresses his son? It says,

<br/>
    <div class="center">“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline,
    <br/>
    and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
    <br/>
    <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>
    because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
    <br/>
    and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”
<br/>
</div>
    <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>
    Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For
what children are not disciplined by their father?    <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>If you are not disciplined—and everyone
    undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and
    daughters at all. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Moreover, we have all had
    human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much
more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!    <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>They disciplined us for a little while as
    they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we
    may share in his holiness. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>No discipline
    seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a
    harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
</blockquote>
<p>
    We have seen that as our Creator, God is our Father (and that this applies
    to everyone). Now we see the purpose of His judgment. Like a good father,
    He “disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his
    holiness.” The painful discipline we receive, whether in this life or
    after, serves an amazing purpose, producing “a harvest of righteousness and
    peace.” God’s role as Heavenly Father fits perfectly with the view that all
    mankind will be saved, although for the rebellious it is clear that the
    discipline received on the day of judgment will be more painful.

    Advice From the Father on How to Be a Good Father
</h2>
<h3>
    <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Ephesians/6/4">Ephesians 6:4</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
    discipline and instruction of the Lord.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Proverbs/22/6">Proverbs 22:6</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old he will not
    depart from it.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/Colossians/3/21">
        Colossians 3:21
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.
</blockquote>
<p>
    We can see from the verses above that fathers are exhorted to discipline,
    train, and teach their children. And we are to do so in such a way that we
    don’t exasperate them. Is God asking us to be like Him because He
    disciplines and trains us for our good?
</p>
<p>
    I think so.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    God is characterized as the Heavenly Father of everyone. And he is a good
    Father who loves us, has compassion on us, and gives us His good gifts. He
    disciplines us purposefully in order to produce a “harvest of
    righteousness.” He encourages us to be like Him as earthly parents by
    training up our own children just as He does. He is the model.
</p>
<p>
    With this in mind, it is wholly unreasonable to say that our Father will
torment His children endlessly in hell. This is    <em>not how He characterizes Himself</em>. Far be it from us to impose such
    a doctrine on Him. Any earthly father who vengefully tortures his children
    is rightly deemed an immoral monster. We know this is wrong. Everybody
    knows it. <em>You </em>know it!
</p>
<p>
    He has shown us the purpose of judgment. It is for discipline and
    correction for he is our Father who loves us.
</p>
<p>
    We will see next that this principle holds true throughout the history of
    the Bible in the judgment of nations as well. <em></em>
