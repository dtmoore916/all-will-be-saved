<h2>
    The Redemptive Purpose of Judgment in History
	(Part 1)
</h2>
<p>
    Throughout the Bible, it can be clearly seen that God’s judgments are
    purposeful and redemptive. Although for the sake of time we won’t cover
    every instance of God’s judgment in the Bible, the examples given are
    highly illustrative and representative of this concept.
</p>
<h4>
    Noah’s Ark
</h4>
<p>
    The story of Noah’s ark is one of the earliest instances of judgment
    recorded in the Bible. In it, God floods the earth, for good reason:
</p>
<h3>
    Genesis 6:5
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and
    that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
</blockquote>
<p>
    I don’t know about you, but I don’t think the world would have been a great
    place to live if people only had evil on their minds all the time. Picture
    the most brutal, vile regime you can imagine in modern or ancient history.
    Wouldn’t God be right to judge and put an end to such a regime? Don’t we
    often wonder why He doesn’t stop the evil in the world?
</p>
<p>
    Well, in Noah’s day, He did. And here’s the really remarkable part: even
    this judgment was redemptive as explained in the book of 1 Peter.
</p>
<h3>
   1 Peter 3:18-20 (ESV)
</h3>
<blockquote>
    For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous,
    that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made
    alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in
    prison, <strong>because they formerly did not obey</strong>, when God's
    patience waited <strong>in the days of Noah</strong>…
</blockquote>
<p>
    What? Even those men who were so wicked that they only thought evil
    thoughts all the time were preached to by Jesus? Why? Was it just to mock
    them because they had no hope for escaping hell?
</p>
<p>
    No! Instead we see Jesus purpose in preaching to these captives in Isaiah
61:1 and Luke 4:18. They say He was sent “to    <strong>proclaim liberty</strong> to <strong>the captives.” </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This is confirmed in 1 Peter 4:6 which states that “this is why the gospel
    was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh
    the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.”
</p>
<p>
    So, in Noah’s day, God judged evil temporally in order to purify the world
    (benefiting mankind) and offers redemption in Christ even to the evil men
    that were judged <em>post mortem</em>!
</p>
<p>
    This is incredible grace and mercy within His judgment! I think this is one
    reason why Paul exclaims “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and
    knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond
    tracing out! (Romans 11:33).
</p>
<h4>
    Sodom and Gomorrah
</h4>
<p>
    This is certainly one of the most famous examples of God’s judgment in the
    Bible, in which He “rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah”
    (Genesis 19:24). Some are critical of such judgments, saying that they show
    that God does not really care for people. I believe this conclusion is
    false. Rather, it is because of love for humanity that God judges evil.
    Otherwise, the world would be unbearably dark and terrible. And make no
    mistake, Sodom was evil.
</p>
<h3>
    Genesis 4:4-9
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of
Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, “Where are the men who
    came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with
    them.
<br/>
Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this
    wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who
    have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do
    what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have
    come under the protection of my roof.”
  <br>
    “Get out of our way,” they replied. “This fellow came here as a foreigner,
    and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They
    kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Now, I don’t know about you, but I hope I never end up in a city that is so
    wicked that every man is obsessively intent on gang rape. That is a scary
    place. Also, notice that the corruption was so pervasive in the city that
    even Abraham’s nephew Lot (the one considered <em>righteous enough</em> to
    not be destroyed), offered up <em>his own daughters</em> to be raped by
    these men rather than have them rape his guests. In case you aren’t sure,
    that is also very, very wrong (i.e. evil). So, even the most righteous man
    there wasn’t really a model citizen. Far from it.
</p>
<p>
    So God destroyed Sodom and its wickedness. But again we see something
    remarkable. Something surprising. Something unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
    God even redeems Sodom.
</p>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+16:53&amp;version=ESV"
    >
        Ezekiel 16:53
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
I [the LORD] will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of <strong>Sodom</strong> and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and
    her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst.
</blockquote>
<p>
    How is this even possible? Wasn’t Sodom completely destroyed? According to
    the Biblical account, it was. Yet Ezekiel, writing many hundreds of years
    later, is speaking of Sodom’s restoration. This can only be referring to an
    ultimate restoration in the future. I believe it is referring to
    restoration after Sodom’s judgment by Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Jesus also referenced Sodom, saying that it would fare better than the
    Jewish city of Capernaum on judgment day: “And you, Capernaum, will you be
    lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.<sup> </sup> For if
    the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it
    would have remained to this day. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>But I tell
    you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for
    you.” (Matthew 11:23-24).
</p>
<p>
    Although this last passage does not explicitly show Sodom’s redemption, it
    does indicate that there are degrees of judgment, that the consequences for
    sin are not uniform eternal punishment as suggested by the doctrine of
    hell. Instead, the correction we experience will be determined according to
    our deeds as stated throughout the Bible, and will ultimately lead to
    restoration, even for a place like Sodom.
</p>
<h4>
    The Plagues of Egypt
</h4>
<p>
    In the plagues of Egypt, we see another explanation of the purpose of God’s
    judgment, that is reiterated many times in Scripture: His judgments cause
    us to come to know Him and proclaim Him.
</p>
<h3>
    Exodus 9:13-17
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh
    and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let
    my people go, so that they may worship me, or this time I will send the
    full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your
    people,
    <strong>
        so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth
    </strong>
    . For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your
    people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. But I have
    raised you up <strong>for this very purpose</strong>, that
    <strong>
        I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all
        the earth
    </strong>
    .<sup> </sup> You still set yourself against my people and will not let
    them go.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Judgment is a way for God to get through to us. Some of us (perhaps all of
    us) are like Pharaoh: hard-hearted and thick-headed. We need to see His
    awesome power (in the form of judgment) before we are willing to humbly
    acknowledge who we are, in relation to who He is. And because He loves us
    and wants us all to repent, He does what needs to be done so that all will
    hear of his greatness and goodness, and eventually understand.
</p>
<h4>
    Jonah and Nineveh
</h4>
<p>
    The story of Jonah is not really about a big fish. It’s about a prophet who
    did not understand God’s will to save all people, and how God showed His
    will to him. You see, Jonah did not want the people of Nineveh to be saved
    because they were wicked. In fact, he was angry that they were given the
    opportunity to repent, and even angrier that they took it! He was so angry
    that he had a temper tantrum about it. This is what is said of Jonah,
    immediately after Nineveh’s repentance and salvation from temporal
    judgment:
</p>
<h3>
    Jonah 4:1-4
</h3>
<blockquote>
    But it greatly displeased Jonah and he became angry. He prayed to the Lord
    and said, “Please Lord, was not this what I said while I was still in my
    own country? Therefore in order to forestall this I fled to Tarshish, for I
    knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and
    abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents concerning calamity.
    Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for death is better to
    me than life.” The Lord said, “Do you have good reason to be angry?”
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are several really interesting things about this passage, the first
    being Jonah’s anger instead of rejoicing at repentance. I believe this
    shows how far his heart was from God’s in the matter. Jesus said, “I tell
    you … there will be <em>more</em> joy in heaven over one sinner who repents
    than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance” (Luke
    15:7). Obviously this is very different from Jonah’s attitude.
</p>
<p>
    Another interesting aspect of the passage is that Jonah explains his
    reasoning for fleeing to Tarshish rather than obeying God and preaching to
    Nineveh. He <em>did not want</em> the people of Nineveh to be saved and he
    knew that God would save them because he is “a gracious and compassionate
    God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, and one who relents
    concerning calamity.” Again we see God’s character and desire to save.
    Jonah understood God’s character well, but he wanted vengeance, not mercy.
    This is a key difference between us and God and another reason why the
    doctrine of hell has the hallmarks of being man-made rather than
    God-inspired.
</p>
<p>
    Now, even though Jonah is thinking wickedly and unmercifully, God shows him
    mercy by causing a plant to grow nearby to give him shade, and Jonah is
    overjoyed (it sounds really “over the top” in the passage) about the plant.
    But God isn’t content to just give Jonah some physical comfort. Instead, he
    uses the plant to expose both the pride and wickedness in Jonah’s heart, as
    well as the great love found in His own. He does this by causing the plant
    to die via a worm. When it dies, Jonah goes back to his ridiculously
    melodramatic pouting, begging “with <em>all</em> his soul to die” (Jonah
    4:8).
</p>
<h3>
    Jonah 4:9-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then God said to Jonah, “Do you have good reason to be angry about the
    plant?” And he said, “I have good reason to be angry, even to death.” Then
    the Lord said, “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work
    and <em>which</em> you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and
    perished overnight. Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city
in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know    <em>the difference</em> between their right and left hand, as well as many
    animals?”
</blockquote>
<p>
    What does this tell us about God? It tells us that He is compassionate,
    even to those that we consider <em>unredeemable</em>. He forgives those
that we say are <em>unforgivable</em>. He loves those that we believe to be    <em>unlovable</em>.
</p>
<p>
    He wills to save and He will do it, in spite of the resistance of the
    proud, religious mindset.

<h4>
    The humbling of Nebuchadnezzar
</h4>
<p>
    Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon and he was not a nice guy. He threw men
    (Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego) into a fiery furnace for not worshipping
    a statue he set up. He destroyed Jerusalem. He was arrogant, entitled, and
    brutal.
</p>
<p>
    So God warned him in a dream of his impending judgment. Daniel interpreted
    the dream for the king and offered him some wise advice, which was not
    heeded. Let’s read the whole story now, beginning with Daniel’s sage
    counsel.
</p>
<h3>
    Daniel 4:27-37
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Therefore, O king, may my advice be pleasing to you: break away now from
    your sins by <em>doing</em> righteousness and from your iniquities by
    showing mercy to <em>the</em> poor, in case there may be a prolonging of
    your prosperity.’
    <br>
    “All <em>this</em> happened to Nebuchadnezzar the king. Twelve months later
    he was walking on the <em>roof of</em> the royal palace of Babylon. The
    king reflected and said, ‘Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself
    have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory
    of my majesty?’ While the word <em>was</em> in the king’s mouth, a voice
    came from heaven, <em>saying</em>, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is
    declared: sovereignty has been removed from you, and you will be driven
    away from mankind, and your dwelling place <em>will be</em> with the beasts
    of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods
    of time will pass over you until you recognize that the Most High is ruler
    over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.’
    Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was
    driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body
was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’    <em>feathers</em> and his nails like birds’ <em>claws</em>.
<br>
    “But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward
    heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and
    praised and honored Him who lives forever;
<br>
    For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
    <br/>
    And His kingdom <em>endures</em> from generation to generation.
    <br/>
    “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,
    <br/>
    But He does according to His will in the host of heaven
    <br/>
    And <em>among</em> the inhabitants of earth;
    <br/>
    And no one can ward off His hand
    <br/>
    Or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’
<br/>

    At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendor were
    restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counselors and my nobles
    began seeking me out; so I was reestablished in my sovereignty, and
    surpassing greatness was added to me. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt
    and honor the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just,
    and He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are several things to notice about this passage. First, we see that
    Nebuchadnezzar is warned of his impending judgment but in his pride does
    not repent. Second, we see that he is judged severely (7 years of grass
    eating madness). Third, and most importantly, we see the result of the
judgment: he was humbled and acknowledged God. He learned to “<strong>praise, exalt and honor the King of heaven</strong>, for all<strong> His works are true</strong> and <strong>His ways just</strong>, and    <strong>He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</strong>”
</p>
<p>
    Nebuchadnezzar learned, through judgment, to confess allegiance and bow his
    knee to the one true God, just as the Bible says that every person will do
    (Isaiah 45:23, Romans 14:11, Philippians 2:10). This is the purpose of
    God’s judgment. It humbles us so that we can be restored to Him, for “God
    resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble” (James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5).
    For many of us, this humbling happens during our lifetimes. But for others,
    we will be humbled at the last judgment. If you are objecting that this
    humbling through judgment cannot occur after death, I would challenge you
    to find a single Bible verse anywhere that says this to be true. I
    guarantee you won’t find one!
</p>
<p>
    God’s purpose of restoration through judgment is consistent throughout the
    Bible. In the next chapter we will see this to be true in terms of His
    judgments of nations.
