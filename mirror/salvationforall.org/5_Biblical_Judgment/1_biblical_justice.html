<h1>
    What about Judgment? The Biblical Concept of Justice
</h1>

<p>
    It is possible that some may argue that I am ignoring God’s justice, that
    salvation for all sounds nice, but is forgetting that God is just. On the
    contrary, I am quite convinced that God is indeed just and that He will
    righteously judge everyone. I am also convinced that the traditional
    concept of hell is not an accurate biblical representation of God’s
    justice. Let’s begin examining the Biblical concept of justice, beginning
    with the principle that all are judged according to their deeds.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Corinthians 5:9-11
</h3>
<blockquote>
    So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or
    away from it. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us
    for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
<br>

    
    Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade
    others. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your
    conscience.
</blockquote>
<h3>
   Romans 2 
</h3>
<blockquote>
    You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for
    at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because
    you who pass judgment do the same things.  Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on
    truth.  So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape
    God’s judgment?  Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that
    God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?

<br>  
    But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are
    storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his
    righteous judgment will be revealed.  God
    “will <strong>repay each person according to what they have done</strong>.”
  
    
        To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and
        immortality, he will give eternal life.
       But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow
evil, <strong>there will be wrath and anger</strong>.  There will be <strong>trouble and distress</strong> for every human being who does evil:
    first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honor and peace for everyone <strong>who does good</strong>: first
    for the Jew, then for the Gentile.  For God does not show favoritism.
</blockquote>
<h3>Jeremiah 17:10</h3>
<blockquote class="center">

    “I the Lord search the heart

<br/>

    and examine the mind,

<br/>

    to reward each person according to their conduct,

<br/>

    according to what their deeds deserve.”
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Revelation 20
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Then I saw a great white throne and the One who sat on it. The earth and
    the heavens fled from His presence, and no place was found for them.
    And I saw the dead, <strong>great and small,</strong> standing before the throne.  And there were open books, and one of them was the book of life. And the dead were judged
    <strong> according to their deeds,</strong> as recorded in the books.
    The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their dead, and each
    one was <strong>judged according to his deeds.…</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
    There are several key concepts about God’s ultimate judgment of mankind in
    these passages.
</p>
<p>
    First, it is apparent that <em>everyone</em>, including believers will be
    judged.
</p>
<p>
    Second, it is clear that <em>everyone</em> will be judged according to
    their works, whether good or bad.
</p>
<p>
    Third, it is obvious that we are NOT to judge others; that is God’s job.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s examine each of these concepts in turn.
</p>

<h2>Everyone is judged</h2>    

<p>
    I think there is a prevailing notion among Christians today that we escape
    judgment because of our faith in Christ. This is clearly shown to not be
    the case by the verses we just looked at. Everyone, “great and small” is
    judged. What we do as Christians, and how we follow Christ actually matter
and we are rewarded accordingly. We don’t escape judgment, but    <em>condemnation</em> because we are justified by Christ for “there is
    therefore now no <em>condemnation</em> to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”
    (Romans 8:1). It doesn’t say we won’t be judged according to our works,
    just that we won’t be condemned or found guilty. Why? Because of Jesus’
    atoning sacrifice on our behalf of course!
</p>

    <h2>Everyone is judged according to their deeds</h2>


<p>
    The traditional doctrine of hell ascribes eternal punishment to all
    unbelievers, regardless of the types of sins they committed. This is in
    stark contrast to the biblical view that we are judged according to our
    deeds. Some people say that there are different levels of torment in hell
    but the duration is eternal in order to resolve this conflict, but this
    does little to fix the problem. Eternity is still eternity.
</p>
<p>
    How did this concept of essentially equal punishment for sin arise then? I
    believe it is the result of a misinterpretation of the purpose of certain
    Biblical passages.
</p>
<h3>
    James 2:10-13
</h3>
<blockquote>
For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one    <em>point,</em> he is guilty of all. For He
    who said, “Do not commit adultery,”
    also said, “Do not murder.”
    
    Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a
    transgressor of the law. So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.    For judgment is without mercy to the one who
    has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Passages like this are sometimes given as justification for the extreme
    punishment mandated by the doctrine of hell. The reasoning given is that
    all of us have failed to keep the whole law and are therefore guilty of
    breaking the whole law. Therefore, it is argued, we all deserve the same
    eternal punishment. I believe this interpretation is mistaken.
</p>
<p>
    James is not saying that all sins are equal, but rather showing that all of
    us are lawbreakers incapable of earning our own salvation. We are all
    equally in need of Christ’s salvation. He is also encouraging us to live
    freely following Christ, being “judged by the law of liberty.”
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, the verse also encourages us to be merciful and concludes
    that “mercy triumphs over judgment.” It is quite odd, obviously, to use
    such a passage as proof that God will judge the world without mercy for the
    lost.
</p>
<h2>Don’t Judge Others</h2>
    
<p>
    There is a tendency in some Christian circles to be judgmental of other
    people. Unfortunately, this probably doesn’t surprise you. But it should.
    Jesus Christ, whom we claim to follow as Christians, was emphatic that we
    should not judge others. Let’s examine a couple of his statements next…
</p>
<h3>
        Matthew 7:1-5
    
</h3>
<p>
    “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge
    others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be
    measured to you.
</p>
<p>
    “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no
    attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother,
    ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank
    in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye,
    and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
</p>
<h3>
    <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+6:37-42">
        Luke 6:37-42
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    
        “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will
        not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will
        be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and
        running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you
        use, it will be measured to you.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    John 8:3-10
</h3>
<blockquote>
    The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in
    adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, “Teacher,
    this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us
    to stone such women. Now what do you say?” They were using this question as
    a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and
    started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on
    questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you
    who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped
    down and wrote on the ground. At this, those who heard began to go away one
    at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman
    still standing there.
<br>
    Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one
    condemned you?”
<br>

    “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared.
    “Go now and leave your life of sin.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    These are not the only passages that indicate that we should not judge
others. They emphatically declare that we should not judge and that    <em>if we do</em>, we will be judged in the same manner. I know that deters
    me from wanting to stand in harsh judgment over anyone else!
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, I’ve heard people say (on multiple occasions) that so and so
    “isn’t saved.” This has always bothered me and I hope it vanishes from
    Christian vernacular. We are incapable of judging the state of salvation of
    other people and are expressly told not to! Only God knows our hearts. If
    someone doesn’t profess to be a believer, we can be precise and use this
    same language in describing their views.
</p>
<p>
    It is also important to remember that we too are in the process of “being
    saved” (1 Corinthians 1:18). And we can thank God for His grace in doing
    so, and for His goodness in desiring and working toward the salvation of
    all mankind.
</p>

    <h2>Justice In The Old Testament Law</h2>

<p>
    To understand the justice of God, it is important to look at the law of
    God. In the Old Testament, the law was given to govern the Israelites,
    God’s chosen people. Understanding this law is useful for informing our
    view of his ultimate judgment of mankind as well.
</p>
<p>
So, what do we see in the Old Testament law? Significantly, we <em>never see a single example anywhere</em> of unending punishment or of
    torture in the law. Not ever.
</p>
<p>
    Instead we see fairness. Injuries are repaid “fracture for fracture, eye
    for eye, tooth for tooth” (Leviticus 24:20).
</p>
<p>
    And in the New Testament clarifications given by Jesus of the law, we see
    mercy!
</p>
<h3>
    Matthew 5:38
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a
    tooth.’ But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you
    on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Was Jesus abolishing the law of Moses? We will use His own words to answer
    this question. He said “Do not think that I
    have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish
    them but to fulfill them” (Matthew 5:17).
</p>
<p>
    So, Jesus is saying that he is fulfilling the law, by showing the true
    heart of the law: love. This is why, when questioned about the greatest
    commandment in the law, Jesus responded:
</p>

    <h3>Matthew 22:37-40</h3>
<blockquote>
    “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
    with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the
    second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the
    Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that <em>all</em> of the Law and Prophets are about love for God and
    love for others! This is significant, showing that all of God’s justice
    flows from His love.
</p>
<p>
    Now let’s take a look at the most well-known of the Old Testament laws, the
    Ten Commandments, to see this principle.
</p>

    <h3>Exodus 20:1-17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
    And God spoke all these words:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>
    “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of
    slavery.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>
    “You shall have no other gods before
    me.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven
above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.    <strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>You shall not bow down to them or worship
    them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children
    for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who
    hate me, <strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>but showing love to a thousand
    generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lordwill not
    hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.    <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Six days you shall labor and do all your
    work, <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>but the seventh day is a sabbath to
    the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your
    son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any
    foreigner residing in your towns. <strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>For in six
    days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in
    them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the
    Sabbath day and made it holy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>
    “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land
    the Lord your God is giving you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not murder.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not commit adultery.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not steal.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>
    “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your
    neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or
    anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Notice that the first three commandments deal with loving God. The fourth,
    keeping the Sabbath, is about both loving God by obeying Him, but also
    about Him loving us and giving us rest. As Jesus said, "The Sabbath was
    made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). Finally, the last six
    commandments are about loving one another. From numerous passages, it is
    clear that loving others is also a way in which we love God. So we see that
    the Ten Commandments can indeed be summed up, as Jesus stated, by the two
    greatest commandments.
</p>


    <h2>Social Justice</h2>

<p>
    In addition, we see that much of the Old Testament law is about caring for
    others. And most of the judgments carried out against civilizations are due
    to the fact that people did not care for others.
</p>

    <h3>Leviticus 19:15</h3>

<blockquote>
    "Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism
    to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly."
</blockquote>

    <h3>Leviticus 23:22</h3>

<blockquote>
    "When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of
    your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor
    and the alien. I am the LORD your God."
</blockquote>
    <h3>Leviticus 19:33-34</h3>
<blockquote>
    Do not mistreat foreigners who are living in your land. Treat them as you
    would an Israelite, and love them as you love yourselves. Remember that you
    were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
</blockquote>

    <h3>Ezekiel 16:49</h3>

<blockquote>
    Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were
arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they    <strong>did not help the poor and needy</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
    What? Wasn’t <em>sodomy</em> the sin of Sodom? Apparently not. This is not
to say this wasn’t <em>a</em> <em>sin</em> of Sodom, but it clearly wasn’t    <em>the sin</em> that God was most concerned with in this passage.
</p>
<h3>Zechariah 7:9-11 (ESV)</h3>  

	<blockquote>
		“Thus says the Lord of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and
    mercy to one another, do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the
    sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in
    your heart.” But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn
    shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.
	</blockquote>
    <h3>Isaiah 1:17</h3>

<blockquote>
    "Learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause
    of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow."
</blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 3:14-15</h3>

<blockquote>
    "The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his
    people: It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is
    in your houses. What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the
    faces of the poor?' declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty."
</blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 10:1-3</h3>

<blockquote>
    Woe to those who make unjust laws,
    <br/>
    to those who issue oppressive decrees,
    <br/>
    
    to deprive the poor of their rights
    <br/>
    and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people,
    <br/>
    making widows their prey
    <br/>
    and robbing the fatherless.
    <br/>
    
    What will you do on the day of reckoning,
    <br/>
    when disaster comes from afar?
    <br/>
    To whom will you run for help?
    <br/>
    Where will you leave your riches?
</blockquote>
    <h3>Isaiah 11:4</h3>

<blockquote>
    "With righteousness he will judge the needy; with justice he will give
    decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod
    of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked."
</blockquote>
<p>
    The New Testament reiterates the importance of caring for those in need
    repeatedly.
</p>

    <h3>Matthew 25:31-40</h3>

<blockquote>
    “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then
    he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the
    nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd
    separates the sheep from the goats. And he
will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.   
<br/>
    Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by
    my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
    world. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>For I was hungry and you gave me food,
    I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,
    I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in
    prison and you came to me.’
<br/>

    “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and
feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?    <strong><sup> </sup></strong> When did we see you a stranger and invite you
    in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in
    prison and go to visit you?’
<br/>

    “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the
    least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
</blockquote>
                <h3>James 1:27</h3>
<blockquote>
    Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to
    visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained
    from the world.
</blockquote>
    <h3>Luke 4:17-20 (ESV)</h3>

<blockquote>
    And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him [Jesus]. He unrolled
    the scroll and found the place where it was written,
    “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
    <br/>
    because he has anointed me
    <br/>
    to proclaim good news to the poor.
    <br/>
    He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives
    <br/>
    and recovering of sight to the blind,
    <br/>
    to set at liberty those who are oppressed,
    <br/>
   
    to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.”


    And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down.
And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, “Today this
    Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is just a sampling. We could spend hours on all of the verses that
    speak of God’s love for the needy, the foreigner, the oppressed and the
    alone. What all of these passages show us is clear. If we are seeing God’s
    justice accurately, we must see his sense of social justice. He cares about
    people, and seems to have a special place in his heart for those that
    society marginalizes. Again and again in the prophets, we see this being
    one of the key reasons for judgment upon nations. We also see it as a
    primary determining factor in the consequences or rewards we receive when
    Jesus comes in his glory, separating the sheep from the goats (the
    righteous from the unrighteous).
</p>
<p>
    Now consider the fact that the vast majority of people groups that have not
    been reached with the gospel of Jesus Christ live in developing countries
    and experience a great deal of poverty and oppression. Aren’t these the
    very people that God expresses deep love for throughout all of these
    passages? Is it consistent with God’s justice for Him to condemn them to
    eternal suffering in hell? Or will He save them, as He has stated
    throughout His Word?
