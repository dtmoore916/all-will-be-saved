<h2>
    The history of Israel, Judah and Other Nations as a Pattern for Judgment
</h2>

<p>
    In the Old Testament, many of the events in Israel’s history (and the 
	entire Bible) are symbolic of greater truths (Abraham and Isaac, the 
	sacrificial system, the book of Hosea, Jonah in the belly of the fish, many 
	of the prophecies that seemed to have a historical, fulfillment and a future 
	one as well etc.) Although I won’t spend time on all of these now, it is 
	clear that they all foreshadowed future events and give us deeper 
	understanding of these events. It is wise to interpret passages in the
    Bible in light of other passages in the Bible, with a great deal of
    foreshadowing being done in the Old Testament. With this in mind, we
    frequently see judgment of Israel, Judah, and other nations in the Old
    Testament.
</p>
<p>
    Some people mistakenly view God as a tyrant because of his Old Testament
    judgments. The stated goal of these judgments, however, is clear: they are
    meant to bring people back to God. Because there are so many verses dealing
    with this concept, we will not exhaustively examine all of them, but the
    themes are consistent throughout.
</p>
<h4>
    Warning of Judgment Precedes Judgment

        Ezekiel 18:30
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Therefore, you Israelites, I will judge each of you according to your own
    ways, declares the Sovereign Lord. <strong>Repent</strong>! Turn away from
    all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.
</blockquote>

</h3>
<blockquote>
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.    <strong>Repent</strong> and live!
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a

    >
        Jeremiah 18:11
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    “Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem,
    ‘This is what the Lord says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and
    devising a plan against you. So <strong>turn</strong> from your evil ways,
    each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’
</blockquote>
<h3>
    <a
        href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+26:3&amp;version=NIV"
    >
        Jeremiah 26:3
    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
    Perhaps they will listen and each will <strong>turn</strong> from their
    evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was
    planning because of the evil they have done.
</blockquote>
<p>
    God repeatedly warns the nation of judgment, so that they might repent and
turn from their evil ways. Notice also, that God takes “    <em>no pleasure in the death of anyone.</em>” Repentance is the goal of
    judgment. But it is certainly better to repent now than wait for judgment.
    The judgments on Judah and Israel carried out as the result of invasion and
    destruction by brutal foreign empires would have best been avoided.
</p>
<p>
    But people are often foolish, and we know that judgment did in fact occur.
    Notice, however, the results of God’s judgment carried out.
</p>
<h3>
    Ezekiel 16:42
</h3>
<blockquote>
   
    Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away
    from you; I will be calm and no longer angry.
</blockquote>
<p>
    In this verse, God is saying that his wrath against his people is
    temporary, that it will subside after judgment is carried out. How contrary
    to the idea of eternal hell, and how compatible with the idea of universal
    reconciliation of people!

<blockquote>
    But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the
prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they <strong>repent</strong><strong>ed</strong> and said, ‘The Lord Almighty    <strong>has done to us what our ways and practices deserve</strong>, just
    as he determined to do.’”

    scattered among the lands and nations. <strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Then
    in the nations where they have been carried captive, those who escape will
    remember me—how I have been grieved by their adulterous hearts, which have
    turned away from me, and by their eyes, which have lusted after their
    idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all
their detestable practices. <strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>    <strong>And they will know that I am the </strong><strong>Lord</strong>
    <strong>

    despised my oath by breaking the covenant. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>Yet
    I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and
I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.<sup> </sup> Then you    <strong>will remember your ways and be ashamed</strong> when you receive
    your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger.
    I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant
    with you. <sup> </sup>
    <strong>
        So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am
        the
    </strong>
    <strong>Lord</strong>
. Then, when    <strong> I make atonement for you for all you have done, </strong>you will
    remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your
    humiliation, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Joel 2:27

    </a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he <strong>fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart</strong>. In days to
    come you will understand it clearly.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Notice that in through of these judgments, God is making himself known to
people. It is always purposeful!&nbsp; As we have discussed, His purpose to save 
	people is well established as He is "not willing that any should perish but 
	that all should come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).&nbsp; He is judging 
	people    <em>as they deserve</em> to be judged, but this is <em>never</em> an
    eternal judgment. Rather it is restorative and He atones for all of their
    wrongdoings.&nbsp; It is humbling, causing the people to be ashamed, but even
    this shame is removed once restoration is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    We will next see that this purpose of restoration is true of other nations
    besides Israel and Judah as well.
</p>
<h3>
    Isaiah 49:26 (referring to judgment of other nations)
</h3>
<blockquote class="center">

<br/>
    your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

<h3>
    Ezekiel 25-29
	Summary</h3>
<p>
    In Ezekiel 25, we see God judging several nations, including Ammon, Moab,
    Edom, and Philistia. The purpose of these judgments is repeated several
    times throughout the chapter, that “they will know that I am the LORD.” The
    chapter concludes with this statement in verse 17, “I will carry out great
    vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I
    am the Lord, when I take vengeance on them.”
</p>
<p>
    We see a continuation of this theme in Ezekiel 26-29 with the judgment of
    Tyre, Sidon, and Egypt. For each of these nations, we see that judgment is
    carried out with a purpose, stated by God repeatedly: “Then they will know
    that I am the Lord.”
</p>
<p>
    It would be a grave mistake to take the “vengeance” described in these
    passages as purposeless retribution. There is clearly a restorative goal.
    The judgments are temporary and cause people to better know who God is, a
    God who saves and loves us all.
</p>
<p>
    Without judgment, people would continue to ruin ourselves. As Ecclesiastes
    8:11 states: "because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed
    quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among them are given fully
    to do evil." Swift judgment is corrective. Look at the evils in the world.
    Don’t we need correction?
</p>
<p>
    This is why judgment is something to rejoice about as described in Psalm
    98.
</p>
<h3>
    Psalm 98
</h3>
<blockquote>
    O sing to the Lord a new song,
    <br/>
    For He has done wonderful things,
    <br/>
His right hand and His holy arm have    <strong>gained the victory for Him</strong>.
    <br/>
    <strong>The </strong>
    <strong>Lord</strong>
    <strong> has made known His salvation;</strong>
    <br/>
    <strong>
        He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.
    </strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        He has remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness to the house
        of Israel;
        <br/>
        All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God
    </strong>
    .

<br/>
    Shout <strong>joyfully</strong> to the Lord, all the earth;
    <br/>
    Break forth and sing for <strong>joy</strong> and sing praises.
    <br/>
    Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre,
    <br/>
    With the lyre and the sound of melody.
    <br/>
    With trumpets and the sound of the horn
    <br/>
    Shout <strong>joyfully</strong> before the King, the Lord.
<br/>

    Let the sea roar and all it contains,
    <br/>
    The world and those who dwell in it.
    <br/>
    Let the rivers clap their hands,
    <br/>
    Let the mountains sing together for joy
    <br/>
    Before the Lord, for He is coming to judge the earth;
    <br/>
    <strong>He will judge the world with righteousness</strong>
    <strong>
        <br/>
        And the peoples with equity.

    Notice the joy that his righteous judgment should bring and how it is
    linked to his salvation being made known to “all the ends of the earth.”
    Notice too that “His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory
    for Him.” He accomplishes his purposes by His power. It is not up to us. He
    will be victorious and we have already studied the purpose that He will
    succeed at accomplishing: the salvation for all and unification of all
    things under his authority.&nbsp; This is truly good news that's worth 
	sharing and rejoicing about!</p>
